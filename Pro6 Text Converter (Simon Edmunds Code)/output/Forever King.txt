With my life,
I will love you

With my soul,
I will sing

There's no other above You
You are forever King

Oh God of ages past
Oh Lord of all
my days

You are the First
and Last
Perfect in every way

With my life,
I will love you

With my soul,
I will sing

There's no other above You
You are forever King

Oh son of God
you reign
Your kingdom
has no end

The saints declare Your name
Your blood
defeated sin

With my life,
I will love you

With my soul, 
I will sing

There's no other above You
You are forever King

Oh Holy Spirit here
Mystery of God revealed

Draw me ever near
To You my all I yield

With my life,
I will love you

With my soul,
I will sing

There's no other above You
You are forever King
