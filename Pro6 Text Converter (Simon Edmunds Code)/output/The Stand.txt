Verse 1:
You stood before creation
eternity in Your hand

You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

Verse 2:
You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame

My sin weighed upon Your shoulders
My soul now to stand

Pre-chorus 1:
So what can I say

And what could I do
But offer this heart O God

Completely to You

Verse 3:
So I'll walk upon salvation
Your Spirit alive in me

This life to declare Your promise
My soul now to stand

Pre-chorus 1:
So what can I say

And what could I do
But offer this heart O God

Completely to You
Pre-Chorus 2:

So what can I say
And what could I do

But offer this heart O God
Completely to You

Chorus:
So I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned

In awe of the One who gave it all
I'll stand

My soul Lord to You surrendered
All I am is Yours

Outro:
All I am is Yours

All I am is Yours
Pre-Chorus 2:

So what can I say
And what could I do

But offer this heart O God
Completely to you
