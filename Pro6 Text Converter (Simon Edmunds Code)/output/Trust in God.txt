Verse 1
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine

He's been my fourth man in the fire
time after time

Born of His Spirit
washed in His blood

And what He did for me on Calv'ry
is more than enough

Chorus
I trust In God
my Savior

The One who will never fail
He will never fail

Verse 2
Perfect submission
all is at rest

I know the author of tomorrow
has ordered my steps

So this is my story
and this is my song

Praising my risen King and Savior 
all the day long

Bridge 1
I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

That's why I trust Him
that's why I trust Him
