Verse 1
No place I'd rather be
No place I'd rather be
No place I'd rather be

Than here in your love
Here in your love

Chorus
Set a fire down in my soul
that I can't contain, 
that I can't control
I want more of you God

Bridge
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more
I want more of you God
