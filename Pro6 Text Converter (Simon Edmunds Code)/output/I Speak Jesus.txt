Verse 1
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
Over ev'ry heart and ev'ry mind

'Cause I know there is peace within Your presence
I speak Jesus

Verse 2
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
'Til ev'ry dark addiction starts to break

Declaring there is hope and there is freedom
I speak Jesus

Chorus
Your Name is power, Your Name is healing
Your Name is life

Break ev'ry stronghold, shine through the shadows
Burn like a fire

Verse 3
I just want to speak the Name of Jesus
Over fear and all anxiety

To ev'ry soul held captive by depression
I speak Jesus

Bridge
Shout Jesus from the mountains, and Jesus in the streets
Jesus in the darkness over ev'ry enemy

Jesus for my fam'ly, I speak the holy Name of Jesus
