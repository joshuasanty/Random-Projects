Verse 1:
See on the hill of Calvary

My Savior bled for me

My Jesus set me free

Look at the wounds that give me life

Grace flowing from His side

No greater sacrifice

Chorus:

What He's done, what He's done

All the glory and the honor to the Son

My sins are forgiven, my future is Heaven

I praise God for what He's done

I praise God for what He's done

Verse 2:

Sing for the freedom He has won

Even death is dead and done

His life has overcome

Speak say the Name above all names

Over every broken place

He is risen from the grave

Bridge:

Now on a throne of majesty

The Father's will complete He reigns in victory

Sing hallelujah to the King

He is worthy to receive

All the worship we can bring

Sing hallelujah to the King

He is worthy to receive

All the worship we can bring

My sins are forgiven, my future is Heaven

I praise God for what He's done
