Verse 1
Alone in my sorrow 
and dead in my sin

Lost without hope 
with no place to begin

Your love made a way
 to let mercy come in

When death was arrested 
and my life began

Verse 2
Ash was redeemed 
only beauty remains

My orphan heart 
was given a name

My mourning grew quiet 
my feet rose to dance

When death was arrested
 and my life began

Chorus
Oh your grace so free, 
washes over me

You have made me new, 
now life begins with you

Verse 3
Released from my chains 
I'm a prisoner no more

My shame was a ransom 
he faithfully bore

He cancelled my debt and 
he called me his friend

When death was arrested 
and my life began

Chorus 2
It's your endless love,
 pouring down on us

You have made us new, 
now life begins with you

Verse 4
Our Savior displayed 
on a criminal's cross

Darkness rejoiced as 
though heaven had lost

But then Jesus arose with 
our freedom in hand

That's when death was arrested 
and my life began

Bridge
Oh we're free free, 
forever we're free

Come join the song 
of all the redeemed

Yes we're free free, 
forever amen

When death was arrested 
and my life began
