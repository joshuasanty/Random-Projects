Verse 1
Your love is devoted
Like a ring of solid gold

Like a vow that is tested
Like a convenant of old

Your love is enduring
Through the winter rain

And beyond the horizon
With mercy for today

Pre-Chorus
Faithful You have been
And faithful You will be

You pledge yourself to me
And it's why I sing

Chorus
Your praise will 
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips

Your praise will 
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips

Your praise will 
Ever be on my lips
Ever be on my lips

Verse 2
You Father the orphan
Your kindness makes us whole

And You shoulder 
our weakness

And Your strength
becomes our own

Verse 3
Now You're making me like You
Clothing me in white

Bringing beauty from ashes
For You will have Your bride

Pre-Chorus 2
Free of all her guilt
And rid of all her shame

And known by her true name
And it's why I sing

Bridge
You will be praised
You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

You will be praised
You will be praised

With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord

And it's why I sing
