Verse 1
I've carried a burden
For too long on my own

I wasn't created
To bear it alone

I hear Your invitation
To let it all go

I see it now I'm laying it down
And I know that I need You

Chorus
I run to the Father. I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding. No reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon. My soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father. Again and again
And again and again

Verse 2
You saw my condition
Had a plan from the start

Your Son for redemption
The price for my heart

I don't have a context
For that kind of love

I don't understand. I can't comprehend
All I know is I need You

Chorus
I run to the Father. I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding. No reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon. My soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father. Again and again
And again and again

Bridge 1
My heart has been in Your sights
Long before my first breath

Running into Your arms
Is running to life from death

I feel this rush deep in my chest
Your mercy is calling out

Just as I am You pull me in
And I know I need You no

Chorus
I run to the Father. I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding. No reason to wait

My heart needs a surgeon. My soul needs a friend

So I'll run to the Father. Again and again

Found Chorus
I run to the Father. I fall into grace
I'm done with the hiding. No reason to wait

Found Chorus
My heart found a surgeon. My soul found a friend

So I'll run to the Father. Again and again
Again and again
