Verse 1
Great is your faithfulness 
oh God

You wrestle with 
the sinner's heart

You lead us by still 
waters and to mercy

And nothing can 
keep us apart

Pre-Chorus
So remember your people
Remember your children

Remember your promise, 
oh God

Chorus 1
Your grace is enough
Your grace is enough

Your grace is enough 
for me

Verse 2
Great is your love 
and justice God

You use the weak 
to lead the strong

You lead us in the song of
your salvation

And all your people 
sing along

Chorus 2
Your grace is enough
Heaven reaching down to us

Your grace is enough 
for me

Chorus 3
Your grace is enough
I'm covered in your love

Your grace is enough for me
For me
