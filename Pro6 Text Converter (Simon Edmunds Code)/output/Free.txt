Chorus:
Glory to God who gave His son
Glory to God the victory's won

Halleluiah, halleluiah
I am free

Glory to God who bore my shame
Glory to God exalt His name

Halleluiah, halleluiah
I am free

Verse 1:
Who will free me from this body of death
Who will ransom my heart and give me life

Who will set my feet upon a hope
That will not fade away

Verse 2:

You have broken the chains on me
You have silenced condemnation's song

And You set my feet upon a hope
That will not fade away

Bridge:

There is no condemnation
There is no condemnation
Those who are in Christ
Are free

There is no condemnation
There is no condemnation
Those who are in Christ
Are free

Halleluiah, halleluiah
I am free
