You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You knew me before
I took my first breath

And You know 
the day that I will 
breathe the last

You're the Alpha,
Omega,
Beginning and End

Forever to You I sing

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

Into Your hands 
I commit my spirit

You're the only One 
who satisfies my soul

You're the Alpha,
Omega,
Beginning and End

Forever to You I sing

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You knew me before
I took my first breath

And You know the
day that I will 
breathe the last

You're the Alpha,
Omega,
Beginning and End

Forever to You I sing

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
forever

You are God
You are Life

I will worship You
 forever
