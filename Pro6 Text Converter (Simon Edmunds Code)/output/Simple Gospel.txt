Verse 1
I want to know You Lord
like I know a friend

I want to know You Lord

Chorus 1
I'm laying down 
all my religion

I'm laying down 
I want to know You Lord

Verse 2
I used to think 
that I could box You in

But I'm laying down 
I want to know You Lord

Verse 3
Lord I've been told 
to be ashamed

Lord I've been told 
I don't measure up

Lord I've been told 
I'm not good enough
But You're here with me

Bridge
I reach out and You 
find me in the dust

And You say no amount of untruths can separate us

Chorus 2
I will rejoice 
in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in You Lord
