Verse 1
We bow our Hearts
We bend our knees

Oh Spirit come 
make us humble

We turn our eyes 
from evil things

Oh Lord we cast 
down our idols

Chorus
So give us clean hands
Give us pure hearts

Let us not lift our
souls to another

Bridge
Oh God let us be
A generation that seeks

That seeks your face
Oh God of Jacob
