Verse 1
The weapon may be formed but it won't prosper
When the darkness falls it won't prevail

Cause the God I serve knows only how to triumph
My God will never fail

Chorus
I'm gonna see a victory I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

I'm gonna see a victory I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

Verse 2
There's power in the mighty Name of Jesus
Every war He wages He will win

I'm not backing down from any giant
I know how this story ends

Chorus
I'm gonna see a victory - I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

I'm gonna see a victory - I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

Bridge 1
You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good - You turn it for good

You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good - You turn it for good

You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good - You turn it for good

You take what the enemy meant for evil
And You turn it for good - You turn it for good

Chorus
I'm gonna see a victory - I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord

I'm gonna see a victory - I'm gonna see a victory
For the battle belongs to You Lord
