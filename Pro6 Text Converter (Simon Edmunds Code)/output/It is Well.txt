Verse 1
Grander earth 
has quaked before

Moved by the sound 
of His voice

Seas that are 
shaken and stirred

Can be calmed and 
broken for my regard

Chorus
Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You

Through it all, through it all
It is well

Through it all, through it all
My eyes are on You

And it is well with me

Verse 2
Far be it from me to not believe
Even when my eyes can't see

And this mountain
That’s in front of me

Will be thrown into
the midst of the sea

Bridge
So let go, my soul
And trust in Him

The waves and wind 
still know His name

Chorus 2
It is well, with my soul
It is well, with my soul

It is well, with my soul
It is well, it is well with my soul
