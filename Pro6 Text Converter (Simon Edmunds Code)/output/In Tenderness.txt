Chorus
Oh the Love that sought me!
Oh the blood that bought me

Oh the Grace that brought me to the fold of God
Grace that brought me to the fold of God

Verse 1
In tenderness he sought me
Weary and Sick with Sin

And on His Shoulders brought me
Back to His Fold Again

While angels in His presence sang,
Until the courts of Heaven rang

Verse 2
He died for me while I was singing
Needy and poor and blind

He whispered to assure me
"I've found thee; thou art mine

I never hear a sweeter voice
it made my aching heart rejoice

Verse 3
Upon His grace I'll ponder
and sing anew His praise

With all the adoring wonder,
His blessings I retrace

It seems as if eternal days
are far too short to sing His Praise
