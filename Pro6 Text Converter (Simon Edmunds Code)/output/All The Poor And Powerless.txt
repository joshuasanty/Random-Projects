Verse 1
All the poor and powerless
And all the lost and lonely

All the thieves 
will come confess

And know that You are holy
And know that You are holy

Chorus
And all will sing out
Hallelujah

And we will cry out
Hallelujah

Verse 2
And all the hearts 
that are content

And all who feel unworthy

And all who hurt 
with nothing left

Will know that You are holy
Will know that You are holy

Bridge
Shout it 
Go on and scream it
 from the mountains

Go on and tell it to the masses
That He is God
