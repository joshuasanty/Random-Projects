The heavens are 
Your tabernacle

God of wonders 
beyond our galaxy

You are holy, holy

The universe declares 
Your majesty

You are holy, holy

Lord of heaven and earth
Lord of heaven and earth

Early in the morning
I will celebrate the light

And as I stumble 
through the darkness

I will call Your name 
by night

Hallelujah to the Lord

Hallelujah to the Lord 
of heaven and earth

Hallelujah to the Lord 
of heaven and earth

Hallelujah to the Lord 
of heaven and earth
