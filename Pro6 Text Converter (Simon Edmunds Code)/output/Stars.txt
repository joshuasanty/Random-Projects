Verse 1
You spoke a word and life began
Told oceans where to start and where to end

You set in motion time and space
But still You come and You call to me by name

But still You come and You call to me by name

Chorus 1
If You can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same

Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break

So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars

Verse 2
The deepest depths, the darkest nights
Can't separate, can't keep me from Your sight

I get so lost, forget my way
But still You love and You don't forget my name

Chorus 2
If You can hold the stars in place
You can hold my heart the same

Whenever I fall away
Whenever I start to break

So here I am, lifting up my heart
If You can calm the raging sea

You can calm the storm in me
You're never too far away

You never show up too late
So here I am, lifting up my heart

To the one who holds the stars

Bridge
Your love has called my name
What do I have to fear

What do I have to fear

Tag
So here I am, lifting up my heart
To the one who holds the stars
