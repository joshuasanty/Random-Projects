Verse 1
Let praise be a weapon
That silences the enemy

Let praise be a weapon
That conquers all anxiety

Let it rise
Let praise arise

Verse 2
We sing Your name in the dark
And it changes ev'rything

We sing with all we are
And we claim Your victory

Let it rise
Let praise arise

We'll see you break down ev'ry wall
We'll watch the giants fall

For fear cannot survive when we praise You
The God of breakthrough's on our side

Forever lift Him high
With all creation cry God we praise You

Interlude
Oh we praise You Oh

Verse 3
Let faith be the song
That overcomes the raging sea

Let faith be the song
That calms the storm inside of me

Let it rise
Let faith arise

Oh we praise You
Oh we praise You

Oh we praise You
Oh we praise You

This is what living looks like
This is what freedom feels like

This is what Heaven sounds like
We praise You We praise You

Oh we praise You
Oh we praise You

Oh we praise You
Oh we praise You
