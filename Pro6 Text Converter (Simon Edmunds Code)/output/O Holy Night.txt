Verse 1
O holy night, 
The stars are brightly shining

It is the night
 of the dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world
 in sin and error pining

Till He appeared 
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, 
The weary soul rejoices

For yonder breaks 
A new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees, 
O hear the angel voices

O night divine, 
O night when Christ was born

O night, O holy night, 
O night divine

Verse 2
Led by the light 
Of faith serenely beaming

With glowing hearts 
By His cradle we stand

So led by light 
Of a star sweetly gleaming

Here came the wise 
Men from Orient land

The King of kings 
Lay thus in lowly manger

In all our trials 
Born to be our friend

He knows our need 
To our weakness is no stranger

Behold your King, 
Before him lowly bend

Behold your King, 
Before him lowly bend

Verse 3
Truly He taught us 
To love one another

His law is love 
And His Gospel is peace

Chains shall He break 
For the slave is our brother

And in His Name 
All oppression shall cease

Sweet hymns of joy 
In grateful chorus raise we

Let all within us praise 
His holy Name

Christ is the Lord 
O praise his name forever

His power and glory 
Evermore proclaim
