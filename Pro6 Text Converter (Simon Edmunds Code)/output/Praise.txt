Intro
Let everything
That has breath

Praise the Lord 
Praise the Lord

Verse 1
I'll praise in the valley
Praise on the mountain

I'll praise when I'm sure
And praise when I'm doubting

I'll praise when outnumbered
Praise when surrounded

'Cause praise is the water
My enemies drown in

Pre-Chorus
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to

Chorus 1
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Verse 2
I'll praise when I feel it
And I'll praise when I don't

I'll praise 'cause I know
You're still in control

Because my praise is a weapon
It's more than a sound

Oh, my praise is the shout
That brings Jericho down

Chorus 2
Praise the Lord 
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Bridge 1
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign
Praise 'cause You reign

Praise 'cause You rose 
and defeated the grave

I'll praise 'cause You're faithful
Praise 'cause You're true

Praise 'cause there's nobody 
greater than You

Chorus 3
Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside

I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside

Praise the Lord
Oh, my soul

Ending
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord

Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
