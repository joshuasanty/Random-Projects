Verse 1
He is jealous for me,
Loves like a hurricane, 
I am a tree

Bending beneath the weight of His wind and mercy

When all of a sudden,
I am unaware of these 
Afflictions eclipsed by glory

And I realize just 
How beautiful You are

And how great Your 
Affections are for me

Pre-Chorus
And oh, 
How He loves us, oh

Oh, how He loves us,
How He loves us all

Chorus
Yeah, He loves us,
Oh, how He loves us

Oh, how He loves us,
Oh, how He loves

Bridge
And we are His portion 
And He is our prize

Drawn to redemption by the grace in His eyes

If his grace is an ocean, 
We're all sinking

And Heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss

And my heart turns violently inside of my chest

I don't have time 
To maintain these regrets,
When I think about the way
