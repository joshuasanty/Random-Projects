Verse 1:
From the surface of my skin
To the depths of the soul within

I give you all of me
All the secrets of my heart

Every word and every thought
I give you all of me

Verse 2:
My heart's in need of holding
My soul's in need of truth

Come be near me come surround me

Verse 3:
I lift my hands 
In sweet surrender

I'm falling humbly on my knees
I fix my gaze upon your splendor

How I love your majesty
You captivate me

Verse 4:
Come into my darkest place
Step inside and claim your space

I give you all of me

All the secrets of my heart
Every word and every thought

I give you all of me

Verse 5:
We're lifting up our hands
We're dancing in the streets

We're singing for the praise of your majesty
Listen
