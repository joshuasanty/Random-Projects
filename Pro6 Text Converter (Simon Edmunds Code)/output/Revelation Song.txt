Sing a new song to Him who sits on

Flashes of lighting rolls of thunder

Blessing and honor strength and glory and power be
To You the only wise King

With all creation I sing praise to the King of kings

You are my everything and I will adore You

At the mention of Your name

Jesus Your name is power, breath and living water
Such a marvelous mystery
