Verse 1
In the darkness we were waiting
without hope, without light

Till from heaven you came running
There was mercy in your eyes

To fufill the law and prophets
To a virgin came the Word

From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Chorus 1
Praise the Father Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit three in one

God of glory Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Verse 2
To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the Lost

To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross

For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side

Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died

Verse 3
And the morning that you rose
All of heaven held its breath

Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death

And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe

For the souls of all who'd come
To the father are restored

Verse 4
And the Church of Christ was born
then the spirit lit the flame

Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel shall not faint

By his blood and in his name
In his freedom I am free

For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurected me

Ending
Praise forever to the King of Kings
