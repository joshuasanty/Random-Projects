it's where I find a quiet place

it's where my soul finds sacred space

it's where my knees touch the ground

it's where peace is found

In You

Jesus

it's where my heart is purified

the only place
I feel alive

it's where my father
becons me

it's where this child is meant to be

In You

Jesus

it's where I run
it's where I hide
it's where You hold me
safe inside

it's where I live
It's where I breathe
it's where I look
upon Your beauty

it's where I fall
it's where I rest
it's where I find who
loves me best

In You

Jesus

it's where I tremble
in holy fear

it's where
my questions disappear

it's where my feet
begin to dance

when I realize where I am

I'm In You

Jesus
