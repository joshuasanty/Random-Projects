Verse 1
Savior I come
Quiet my soul remember

Redemptions hill
Where Your blood was spilled
For my Ransom

Pre-Chorus
Everything I once held dear
I count it all as lost

Chorus 1
Lead me to the cross
Where Your love poured out

Bring me to my knees
Lord I lay me down
Rid me of myself

I belong to You
Lead me, lead me to the cross

Verse 2
You were as I
Tempted and tried, Human

The word became flesh
Bore my sin and death
Now you're risen

Bridge 1
To your heart
To your heart

Bridge 1
Lead me to your heart
Lead me to your heart
