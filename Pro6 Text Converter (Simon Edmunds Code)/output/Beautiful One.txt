Verse 1
Wonderful, so wonderful
Is your unfailing love

Your cross has spoken 
mercy over me

No eye has seen 
no ear has heard

No heart could 
fully know

How glorious, 
how beautiful you are

Chorus
Beautiful one I love
Beautiful one I adore

Beautiful one my 
soul must sing

Verse 2
Powerful so powerful
Your glory fills the skies

Your mighty works 
displayed for all to see

The beauty of your majesty
Awakes my heart to see

How marvelous, 
how wonderful you are

Bridge
You opened my eyes to 
your wonders anew

You captured my 
heart with this love

Because nothing on Earth 
is as beautiful as you
