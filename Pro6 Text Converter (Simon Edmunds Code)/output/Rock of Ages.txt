Verse 1
Rock of Ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

Let the water 
and the blood

From Thy wounded 
side which flowed

Be of sin the
double cure

Save from wrath 
and make me pure

Verse 2
Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Your law's demands

Could my zeal no respite know
Could my tears forever flow

These for sin could not atone
You must save, and You alone

Verse 3
Nothing in my hand I bring
Simply to the cross I cling

Naked come to You for dress
Helpless look to You for grace

Foul I to the fountain fly
Wash me Savior or I die

Verse 4
While I draw this 
fleeting breath

When my eyes shall 
close in death

When I rise to worlds unknown
And behold You on the throne

Rock of Ages cleft for me
Let me hide myself in Thee

Let me hide myself in Thee
Let me hide myself in Thee
