Verse 1: 
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war

With the cross of Jesus going on before

Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe

Forward into battle see His banners go

Chorus:
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war

With the cross of Jesus going on before

Verse 2:
At the sign of triumph Satan's host doth flee

On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory

Hell's foundations quiver at the shout of praise

Brothers lift your voices, loud your anthems raise

Verse 3:
Like a mighty army moves the church of God

Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod

We are not divided, all one body we

One in hope and doctrine, one in charity

Verse 4:

What the saints established that I hold for true

What the saints believed, that I believe too

Long as earth endureth, men the faith will hold

Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled

Verse 5:

Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane

But the church of Jesus constant will remain

Gates of hell can never against that church prevail

We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail

Verse 6:

Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng

Blend with ours your voices in the triumph song

Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King

This through countless ages men and angels sing
