Verse 1:
I have a Savior, He died for me

In cruel anguish on Calv'ry's tree

I do not merit such love divine

Only God's mercy makes Jesus mine

Chorus:

Jesus, my Savior, I come to Thee

In full surrender Thine own to be

Verse 2:

I have a Keeper, He now prevails

I fear no evil whate'er assails

His arms enfold me, safe and secure

In His blest keeping vict'ry is sure

Verse 3:

I have a Master, He bids me go

Rescue lost sinners from sin and woe

I love to serve Him, this Master true

Now I am willing His will to do
