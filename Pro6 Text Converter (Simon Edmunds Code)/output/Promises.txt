God of Abraham,
God of covenant and of faithful promises

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn when
You speak a word it will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun, to the setting same
I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me

You're faithful and True

Though the storms may come and the winds may blow
I'll remain steadfast

And let my heart learn when
You speak a word it will come to pass

Great is Your faithfulness to me
Great is Your faithfulness to me

From the rising sun, to the setting same
I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me

My anchor to the ground

My hope and firm foundation
He'll never let me down

From the rising sun, to the setting same
I will praise Your name

Great is Your faithfulness to me
