Verse:
You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words

Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard

Who can grasp your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depths of your love

You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty enthroned above

Chorus:
And I stand, I stand in awe of you
I stand, I stand in awe of you

Holy God to whom all praise is due
I stand in awe of You
