Verse 1:
In the quiet In the stillness
I know that You are God

In the secret Of Your presence
I know there I am restored

Pre-Chorus:
When You call I won't refuse
Each new day again I'll choose

Chorus:
There is no one else for me
None but Jesus

Crucified to set me free
Now I live to bring Him praise

Verse 2:
In the chaos In confusion
I know You're sovereign still

In the moment Of my weakness
You give me grace to do Your will

Pre-Chorus:
So when You call I won't delay
This my song through all my days

Bridge:
All my delight is in You Lord
All of my hope

All of my strength
All my delight is in You Lord

Forevermore
