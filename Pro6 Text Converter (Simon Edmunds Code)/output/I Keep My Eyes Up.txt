Verse 1:
I look to You, not the left or the right
You are my vision, You are the prize

I'm grounded in love, my faith's taking flight
And hope is still burning through the dead of the night

Chorus:
I keep my eyes up, I keep my eyes up
I keep my eyes up, I keep my eyes up

To the one that I love, the one that I trust, Jesus
I keep my eyes up, I keep my eyes up

Verse 2:

Your eyes full of fire, Your face like the sun
Your robe fills the temple, from all the battles You've won

There's nothing to fear 'cause You've overcome
The work that You finished cannot be undone

Bridge:
And when the whole earth is shaking
Heaven keeps singing

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord

And when the whole earth is shaking
Heaven keeps singing

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, yes, I will sing
Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, yes, I will sing

Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
