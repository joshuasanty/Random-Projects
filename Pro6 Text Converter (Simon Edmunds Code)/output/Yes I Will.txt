Verse 1
I count on one thing, the same God that never fails
Will not fail me now, You won't fail me no

In the waiting, the same God who's never late
Is working all things out, You're working all things out

Chorus
Yes I will lift You high
In the lowest valley

Yes I will bless Your name
Yes I will sing for joy

When my heart is heavy
All my days, yes I will

Tag
For All my Days, Yes I will

Bridge 1
I choose to praise
To glorify glorify

The name of all names
That nothing can stand against

Tag
For All my Days, Yes I will
