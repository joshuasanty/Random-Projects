I sought the Lord and He answered me
And delivered me from every fear

Those who look on Him are radiant
They'll never be ashamed they'll never be ashamed

This poor man cried and the Lord heard me
And saved me from my enemies

The Son of God surrounds His saints
He will deliver them He will deliver them

Magnify the Lord with me
come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me
come exalt His name forever

Verse 3
O taste and see that the Lord is good
O blessed is he who hides in Him

O fear the Lord O all you saints
He'll give you everything He'll give you everything

Chorus
Magnify the Lord with me
come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me
come exalt His name forever

Bridge 1
Let us bless the Lord every day and night
Never ending praise may our incense rise

Magnify the Lord with me
come exalt His name together

Glorify the Lord with me
come exalt His name forever
