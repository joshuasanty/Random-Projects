Verse 1
Grace, what have You done?
Murdered for me on that cross

Accused in absence of wrong
My sin washed away in Your blood

Too much to make sense of it all
I know that Your love breaks my fall

The scandal of grace, You died in my place
So my soul will live

Chorus
Oh to be like You
Give all I have just to know You

Jesus, there's no one besides You
Forever the hope in my heart

Verse 2
Death, where is your sting?
Your power is as dead as my sin

The cross has taught me to live
And mercy, my heart now to sing

The day and its trouble shall come
I know that Your strength is enough

The scandal of grace, You died in my place
So my soul will live

Chorus
Oh to be like You
Give all I have just to know You

Jesus, there's no one besides You
Forever the hope in my heart

Oh to be like You
Give all I have just to know You

Jesus, there's no one besides You
Forever the hope in my heart

Bridge 1
And it's all, because of You, Jesus
It's all, because of You, Jesus

It's all, because of Your love that my soul will live

And it's all, because of You, Jesus
It's all, because of You, Jesus

It's all, because of Your love that my soul will live

Chorus
Oh to be like You
Give all I have just to know You

Jesus, there's no one besides You
Forever the hope in my heart
