Verse 1
O come, O come, Emmanuel,
and ransom captive Israel

That mourns in lonely exile here
until the Son of God appear

Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
shall come to thee, O Israel

Verse 3
O come, thou Day-spring, come and cheer

Our spirits by Thine advent here

Disperse the gloomy clouds of night

And death's dark shadows put to flight

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel

Verse 5
O come, 
Thou Key of David, come

And open wide 
our heavenly home

Make safe the way that leads on high

And close the path to misery

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel

Verse 6
O come, O come, Thou Lord of Might

Woe to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height

In ancient times did'st give the La

In cloud, and majesty, and awe

Rejoice! Rejoice! Emmanuel Shall come to thee, O Israel
