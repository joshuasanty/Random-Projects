Verse 1
Let the King of my heart be the mountain where I run

The fountain I drink from oh He is my song

Let the King of my heart be the shadow where I hide

The ransom for my life oh He is my song

Chorus
You are good good oh

Verse 2
Let the King of my heart be the wind inside my sails

The anchor in the waves oh He is my song

Let the King of my heart be the fire inside my veins

The echo of my days oh He is my song

Chorus 1
You are good good oh

Bridge 1
You're never gonna let never gonna let me down

You're never gonna let never gonna let me down

You're never gonna let never gonna let me down

You're never gonna let never gonna let me down

You're never gonna let never gonna let me down

Mashup
I've got a river of life flowing out of me

Makes the lame to walk and the blind to see

Open prison door sets the captive free

I've got a river of life flowing out of me

Spring up oh well... Within my soul

Spring up oh well... And make me whole

Spring up oh well....And give to me

That life ... abundantly
