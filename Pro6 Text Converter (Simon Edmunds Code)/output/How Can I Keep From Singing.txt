Verse 1:
My life flows on in endless song
Above earth's lamentation

I hear the sweet though far off hymn
That hails a new creation

Verse 2:
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing

It finds an echo in my soul
How can I keep from singing

Verse 3:
What though my joys and comforts die
The Lord my Savior liveth

What though the darkness gather round
Songs in the night He giveth

Chorus:
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging

Since Christ is Lord of heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing

Verse 4:
I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin
I see the blue above it

And day by day this pathway smooths
Since first I learned to love it

Verse 5:
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart
A fountain ever springing

All things are mine since I am His
How can I keep from singing
