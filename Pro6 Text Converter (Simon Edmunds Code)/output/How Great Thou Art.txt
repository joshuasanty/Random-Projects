Verse 1
O Lord my God
When I in awesome wonder

Consider all the works 
Thy hands have made

I see the stars
I hear the rolling thunder

Thy power throughout 
the universe displayed

Chorus
Then sings my soul 
My Savior God to Thee

How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Then sings my soul 
My Savior God to Thee

How great Thou art
How great Thou art

Verse 2
When through the woods 
And forest glades I wander

And hear the birds
Sing sweetly in the trees

When I look down 
From lofty mountain grandeur

And see the brook
And feel the gentle breeze

Verse 3
And when I think
That God His Son not sparing

Sent Him to die
I scarce can take it in

That on the Cross 
My burden gladly bearing

He bled and died
To take away my sin

Verse 4
When Christ shall come
With shout of acclamation

And take me home
What joy shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow
In humble adoration

And there proclaim 
My God how great Thou art
