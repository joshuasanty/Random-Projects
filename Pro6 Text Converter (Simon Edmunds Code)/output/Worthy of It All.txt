Verse 1
All the saints and angels 
bow before Your throne

All the elders cast 
their crowns before the 
Lamb of God and sing

Chorus
You are worthy of it all, 
You are worthy of it all

For from You are all things, 
and to You are all things, 
You deserve the glory

Bridge
Day and night, night and day, 
let incense arise
