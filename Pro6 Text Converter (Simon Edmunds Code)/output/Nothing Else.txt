Chorus:
I'm Caught up in Your Presence
I just want to sit here at your feet

I'm caught up in this holy moment
I never want to leave

Oh, I'm not here for blessings
Jesus, you don't owe me anything

More than anything that you do
I just want you

Verse 1:

I'm sorry when I've just gone through the motions

I'm sorry when I just sang another song

Take me back to where we started, I open up my heart to you

Verse 2:

I'm sorry when I've come with my agenda

I'm sorry when I forgot that you're enough

Take me back to where we started, I open up my heart to you

Bridge:
I just want you
Nothing Else, Nothing else

Nothing else will do

I just want you
Nothing Else, Nothing else

Nothing else will do

I just want you
Nothing Else, Nothing else

Nothing else will do

I just want you
Nothing Else, Nothing else

Nothing else will do
