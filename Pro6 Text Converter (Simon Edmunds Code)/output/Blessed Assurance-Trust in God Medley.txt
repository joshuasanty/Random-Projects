Verse 1
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
O what a foretaste of glory divine

Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

Chorus 1
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior, all the day long

This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior, all the day long

Verse 2
Perfect submission, all is at rest
I in my Savior am happy and blessed

Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love

Chorus 2
I trust In God
my Savior

The One who will never fail
He will never fail

Bridge 1
I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

I sought the Lord 
and He heard and He answered

That's why I trust Him
that's why I trust Him

Verse 3
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
He's been my fourth man in the fire

time after time
Born of His Spirit

washed in His blood
And what He did for me on Calv'ry

is more than enough
