Verse 1
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like

But I've heard the tender whisper of love 
In the dead of night

You tell me that Your pleased and that I'm never alone

Chorus
You're a good, good Father
It's who You are

It's who You are, 
It's who You are
And I'm loved by you

It's who I am,
It's who I am,
It's who I am

Verse 2
I've seen many searching for answers far and wide

But I know we're all searching for answers only you provide

'Cause You know just what we need before we say a word

Bridge
You are perfect in 
All of your ways

You are perfect in 
All of your ways

You are perfect in 
All of your ways to us

Verse 3
Love so undeniable I, 
I can hardly speak

Peace so unexplainable I, 
I can hardly think

As You call me deeper still
As You call me deeper still

As You call me deeper still
Into love love love
