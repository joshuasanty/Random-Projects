Verse 1
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind but now I see

Verse 2
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear,
The hour I first believed

Chorus 1
My chains are gone, I've been set free.
My God, My Savior has ransomed me

And like a flood his mercy reigns.
Un-ending love, amazing grace

Verse 3
The Lord has promised good to me,
His word my hope secures

He will my shield and portion be,
As long as life endures

Verse 4
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine

But God, who call'd me here below,
Will be forever mine
