Watchman, tell us of the night, what its signs of promise are

Traveler, over yon mountain's height, see that glory beaming star

Watchman, does its beauteous ray aught of joy or hope foretell

Traveler, yes--it brings the day, promised day of Israel

Watchman, tell us of the night; higher yet that star ascends

Traveler, blessedness and light, peace and truth its course portends

Watchman, will its beams alone gild the spot that gave them birth

Traveler, ages are its own; see, it bursts over all the earth

Watchman, tell us of the night, for the morning seems to dawn

Traveler, darkness takes its flight, doubt and terror are withdrawn

Watchman, let thy wanderings cease; hie thee to thy quiet home

Traveler, lo! the Prince of Peace, lo! the Son of God is come
