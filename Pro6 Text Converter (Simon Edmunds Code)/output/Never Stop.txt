Verse 1
Here in the valley of my soul
When I am lost and all alone

Through the shadows I can see
Your love is chasing after me

Verse 2
You cross the 
canyons of my fears
Over the oceans of my tears

Like the wind 
that moves the trees
Your love is chasing after me

Pre-Chorus
No mountain higher
No river wider

My heart may wander
Your love will never stop 
chasing after me

Chorus
Your love will never stop
Never stop, never stop

Your love will never stop 
chasing after me

Verse 3
You are the sun upon my skin
You are the moon 
that pulls me in

Closer than the air I breathe
Your love is chasing after me

Bridge
I see my chains unraveling
All of my shame for victory

I feel my heart run wild and free
There is no place I’d rather be
