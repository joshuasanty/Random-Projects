Verse 1
From beginning to the end
All my life is in Your hands

This whole world may hold me down
But it can never drown You out

I'm not merely flesh and bone
I was made for something more

Chorus
You are God, You're the Great I Am
Breath of life I breathe You in

Even in the fire I'm alive in You

You are strong in my brokenness
Sovereign over every step

Even in the fire, I'm alive 
I'm alive in You

Verse 2
Through the dark I hear Your voice
Rising up I will rejoice

For I was lost but now I'm found
'Cause even death can't hold You down

Bridge 1
It's no longer I who live

But Christ who lives within me
Christ who lives within me

From beginning to the end

You deserve the glory
You deserve the glory
