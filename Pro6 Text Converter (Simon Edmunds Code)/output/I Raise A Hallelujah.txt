I raise a Hallelujah in the presence of my enemies

I raise a Hallelujah louder than the unbelief

I raise a Hallelujah, my weapon is a melody

I raise a Hallelujah, heaven comes to fight for me

Louder and louder, you're gonna hear my praises roar

Up from the ashes, hope will arise
Death is defeated, the King is alive

I raise a Hallelujah fear you lost your hold on me

Up from the ashes, hope will arise
