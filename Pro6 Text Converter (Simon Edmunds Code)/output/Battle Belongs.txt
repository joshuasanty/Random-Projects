Verse 1
When all I see is the battle You see my victory
When all I see is a mountain You see a mountain moved

And as I walk through the shadow Your love surrounds me
There's nothing to fear now For I am safe with You

Chorus
So when I fight I'll fight on my knees With my hands lifted high
O God the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night
O God the battle belongs to You
O God the battle belongs to You

Verse 2
And if You are for me Who can be against me
For Jesus there's nothing impossible for You

When all I see are the ashes You see the beauty
When all I see is a cross God You see the empty tomb

Chorus 1
So when I fight I'll fight on my knees With my hands lifted high
O God the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night
O God the battle belongs to You
O God the battle belongs to You

Bridge 2
(An) Almighty Fortress You go before us
Nothing can stand against the power of our God

You shine in the shadows You win every battle
Nothing can stand against the power of our God

Chorus 1
So when I fight I'll fight on my knees With my hands lifted high
O God the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night
O God the battle belongs to You
O God the battle belongs to You

So when I fight I'll fight on my knees With my hands lifted high
O God the battle belongs to You

And every fear I lay at Your feet I'll sing through the night
O God the battle belongs to You
O God the battle belongs to You

O God the battle belongs to You
