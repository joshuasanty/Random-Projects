Verse 1
Our God and firm foundation
Our Rock the only solid ground

The nations rise and fall
Kingdoms once strong now shaken

We trust forever in Your name
The name of Jesus

We trust in the name of Jesus

Chorus 1
You are the only King forever
Almighty God we lift You higher

You are the only King forever
Forevermore You are victorious

Verse 2
Unmatched in all Your wisdom
In love and justice You will reign

And ev'ry knee will bow
We bring our expectations

Our hope is anchored in Your name
The name of Jesus

Oh We trust the name of Jesus

Chorus 1
You are the only King forever
Almighty God we lift You higher

You are the only King forever
Forevermore You are victorious

Bridge
We lift our banner high
We lift the name of Jesus

From age to age You reign
Your kingdom has no end
