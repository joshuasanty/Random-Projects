Verse 1
I won't forget the wonder of how You brought
Deliverance, the exodus of my heart

You found me,You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh

Chorus 1
You're the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah, hallelujah

You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah, hallelujah

Verse 2
A cloud by day, a sign that You are with me
The fire by night, a guiding light to my feet

You found me,You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh

Bridge
You stepped into my Egypt
You took me by the hand

You marched me out in freedom 
Into the promised land

Now I will not forget You
I'll sing of all You've done

Death is swallowed up forever 
by the fury of Your love
