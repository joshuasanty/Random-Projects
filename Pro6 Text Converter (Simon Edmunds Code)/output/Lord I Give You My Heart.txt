Verse 1
This is my desire 
to honor You

Lord with all my heart 
I worship You

All I have within me
I give You praise

And all that I adore 
is in You

Chorus
Lord I give You my heart
I give You my soul

I live for You alone
Every breath that I take

Every moment I'm awake
Lord have Your way in me
