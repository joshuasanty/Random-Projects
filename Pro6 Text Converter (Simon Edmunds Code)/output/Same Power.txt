Verse 1
I can see waters raging at my feet
I can feel the breath of those surrounding me

I can hear the sound of nations rising up
We will not be overtaken we will not be overcome

Verse 2
I can walk down this dark and painful road
I can face every fear of the unknown

I can hear all God's children singing out
we will not be overtaken we will not be overcome

Chorus
The same power that rose Jesus from the grave

The same power that commands the dead to wake
Lives in us, lives in us

The same power that moves mountains when He speaks

The same power that can calm a raging sea
Lives in us, lives in us

Lives in us, lives in us

Verse 3
We have hope that His promises are true
In His strength there is nothing we can't do

Yes, we know there are greater things in store
We will not be overtaken we will not be overcome

Bridge
Greater is He that is living in me
He's conquered our enemy

No power of darkness no weapon prevails
We stand here in victory

In victory
