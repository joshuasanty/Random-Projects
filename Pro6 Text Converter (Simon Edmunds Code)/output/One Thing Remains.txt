Chorus
Your love never fails,
never gives up, 
never runs out on me

Your love never fails,
never gives up, 
never runs out on me

Your love never fails, 
never gives up, 
never runs out on me

Your love

Verse 1
Higher than the 
mountains that I face

Stronger than the 
power of the grave

Constant in the trial 
and the change

One thing remains 
One thing remains

Verse 2
On and on and on 
and on it goes

For it overwhelms
and satisfies my soul

And I never ever, 
have to be afraid

One thing remains 
One thing remains

Bridge
In death, 
In life

I'm confident and
covered by the power
of Your great love

My debt 
is paid

There's nothing that can
separate my heart 
from Your great love
