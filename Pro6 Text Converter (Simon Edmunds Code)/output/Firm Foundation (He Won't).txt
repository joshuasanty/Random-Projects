Verse 1
Christ is my firm foundation
The rock on which I stand

When everything around me is shaken
I've never been more glad

That I put my faith in Jesus
Cause He's never let me down

He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now

He won't

Verse 2
I've still got joy in chaos
I've got peace that makes no sense

I won't be going under
I'm not held by my own strength

Cause I've built my life on Jesus
He's never let me down

He's faithful in every season
So why would He fail now

Chorus
He won't He won't
He won't fail He won't fail

Bridge 1
Rain came and wind blew
But my house was built on You

I'm safe with You
I'm going to make it through

I'm going to make it through
Cause I'm standing strong on You

I'm going to make it through
Cause my house was built on You

Verse 1
Christ is my firm foundation
The rock on which I stand

When everything around me is shaken
I've never been more glad

That I put my faith in Jesus
Cause He's never let me down

He's faithful through generations
So why would He fail now

Chorus
He won't He won't
He won't fail He won't fail

Ending
No, He won't
