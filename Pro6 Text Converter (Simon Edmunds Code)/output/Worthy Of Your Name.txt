Intro
You're my King
My King

Verse 1
Rumors of the Son of Man
Stories of a Savior

Holiness with human hands
Treasure for the traitor

Verse 2
No ear had heard, no eye had seen
The Image of the Father

Until heaven came to live with me
A rescue like no other

Chorus
Yes You are worthy
You are worthy of Your Name

You are worthy
You are worthy of Your Name Jesus

Verse 3
You did not speak, You made no sound
You died for Your accusers

As Your blood fell to the ground
You redefined my future

Verse 4
On the day when You arose
The darkness ran for cover

For the King of kings has claimed His throne
Now until forever

Bridge
You're my author, my maker
My ransom, my Savior
My refuge, my hiding place

You're my helper, my healer
My blessed redeemer
My answer, my saving grace

You're my hope, in the shadows
My strength, in the battle
My anchor, for all my days

And You stand, by my side
And You stood, in my place

Jesus, no other name
No, only Jesus, no other name

Chorus 2
Yes You are worthy
You are worthy of Your Name
