Verse 1
I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire

The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes yeah

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin

The people sing
The people sing

Chorus 1
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Verse 2
I see a generation
Rising up to take their place

With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek

We're on our knees
We're on our knees

Chorus 1
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Bridge
Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen

Show me how to love like you, have loved me
Break my heart for what breaks yours

Everything I am for your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth in to eternity

Chorus 1
Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Hosanna Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest

Outro
In the highest
In the highest

Hosanna in the highest
