Verse 1:
Our hands are lifted high
Our hearts are bowing in reverence

And we're surrounded by
The glory of Your presence

With every creature
Every tongue

We're lifting our hearts
To the Glorious One

Chorus:
Glorious One Glorious One
Light of the world You outshine the sun

King of all kings eternity sings
Glorious One

Verse 2:
God of infinite worth
With hands that carved out the ocean

You hold the universe
And still You run to the broken

With every heart
That's been set free

We're lifting our song
To our Glorious king

Bridge: 
There is none more beautiful
There is none more wonderful
