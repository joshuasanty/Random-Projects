Verse 1
When the music fades
All is stripped away
And I simply come

Longing just to bring
Something that's of worth
That will bless Your heart

Pre-Chorus
I'll bring You more than a song
For a song in itself, is not what 
You have required

You search much deeper within
Through the way things appear
You're looking into my heart

Chorus
I'm coming back 
To the heart of worship

And it's all about You,
It's all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord 
For the thing I've made it

When it's all about You
It's all about You, Jesus

Verse 2
King of endless worth
No one could express
How much You deserve

Though I'm weak and poor
All I have is Yours
Every single breath
