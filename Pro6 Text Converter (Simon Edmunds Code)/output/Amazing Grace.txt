Verse 1
Amazing Grace, 
How sweet the sound

That saved a 
wretch like me

I once was lost, 
but now am found

T'was blind, 
but now I see

Verse 2
T'was Grace that taught 
my heart to fear

And Grace,
 my fears relieved

How precious did 
that Grace appear

The hour I 
first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares

I have already come

'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far

And grace will lead me home

The Lord has promised good to me

His Word my hope secures

He will my Shield and Portion be

As long as life endures

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail

And mortal life shall cease

I shall possess, within the veil

A life of joy and peace

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow

The sun forbear to shine

But God, Who called me here below

Shall be forever mine

When we've been there ten thousand years

Bright shining as the sun

We've no less days to sing God's praise

Than when we'd first begun
