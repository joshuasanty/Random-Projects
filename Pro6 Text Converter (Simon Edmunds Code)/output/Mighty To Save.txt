Verse 1
Everyone needs compassion
Love that's never failing

Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness

The kindness of a Savior
The hope of nations

Chorus
Savior
He can move the mountains

Chorus
My God is mighty to save
He is mighty to save

Forever
Author of salvation

He rose and 
conquered the grave

Jesus conquered the grave

Verse 2
So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures

Fill my life again
I give my life to follo

Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Bridge
Shine your light
And let the whole world see

We're singing for the glory
Of the risen King Jesus
