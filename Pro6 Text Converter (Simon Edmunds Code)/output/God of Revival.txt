Verse 1:
We've seen what You can do oh God of wonders
Your power has no end

The things You've done before in greater measure
You will do again

Pre-Chorus:
There's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move all things are possible

There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save all things are possible

Chorus:
The darkest night
You can light it up, You can light it up

God of revival
Let hope arise

Death is overcome You've already won
God of revival

Verse 2:
You rose in victory and now You're seated
Forever on the throne

So why should my heart fear what You defeated
I will trust in You alone

Pre-Chorus:
There's no prison wall You can't break through
No mountain You can't move all things are possible

There's no broken body You can't raise
No soul that You can't save all things are possible

Chorus:
The darkest night
You can light it up You can light it up

God of revival
Let hope arise

Death is overcome You've already won
God of revival

Bridge:
Come awaken Your people come awaken this city
Oh God of revival pour it out pour it out

Every stronghold will crumble I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival pour it out pour it out

Come awaken Your people come awaken this city
Oh God of revival pour it out pour it out

Every stronghold will crumble I hear the chains hit the ground
Oh God of revival pour it out pour it out
