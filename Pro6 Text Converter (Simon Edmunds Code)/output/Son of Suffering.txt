Verse 1:
Oh the perfect Son of God
In all His innocence
Here walking in the dirt with you and me

He knows what living is
He's acquainted with our grief
A man of sorrows Son of suffering

Chorus:
Blood and tears how can it be
There's a God who weeps
There's a God who bleeds

Oh praise the One
Who would reach for me
Hallelujah to the Son of suffering

Verse 2:
Some imagine You are distant and removed
But You chased us down in merciful pursuit
To the sinner You were grace

And the broken You embraced
And in the end the proof is in Your wounds
Yes in the end the proof is in Your wounds

Bridge:
Your cross my freedom
Your stripes my healing

All praise King Jesus
Glory to God in Heaven

Your blood still speaking
Your love still reaching

All praise King Jesus
Glory to God forever

Tag:
Glory to God forever

Outro
All praise King Jesus
All praise King Jesus

All praise King Jesus
Glory to God forever
