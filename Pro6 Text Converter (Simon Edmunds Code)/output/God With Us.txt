Verse 1
You've come to bring peace
To be love, to be nearer to us

You've come to breathe life
To be light, to shine brighter in us

Oh Emmanuel God with us

Chorus
Our Deliverer You are Savior
In Your presence we find our strength

Over everything Our redemption
 God with us, You are God with us

Verse 2
You've come to be hope
To this world

For Your honor and name
You've come to take sin

To bear shame
And to conquer the grave

Oh Emmanuel, oh God with us

Chorus
Our Deliverer You are Savior
In Your presence we find our strength

Over everything Our redemption
 God with us, You are God with us

Bridge
You are here You are holy
We are standing in Your glory

Chorus
Our Deliverer You are Savior
In Your presence we find our strength

Over everything Our redemption
 God with us, You are God with us

Chorus
You are God with us
