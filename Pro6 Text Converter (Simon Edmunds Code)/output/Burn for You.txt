Verse 1:
There's a stirring
in my heart

unexplainable

There's a calling
on my days, undeniable

There's a fire
in my bones, uncontainable

and it's causing me to burn
it's causing me to burn
it's causing me to burn
for You

Verse 2:
There's a passion
in my heart

for the world to see
revival fires burning

great awakening

there's a raging fire inside
this soul of mine

and it's causing me to burn
it's causing me to burn
it's causing me to burn
for You

Chorus:
I'll go anywhere
I'll do anything
at any cost
for You my King

Ending:
to the ends of the earth
to the ends of the earth

to the farthest part
'till every heart has heard
