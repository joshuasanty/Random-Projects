I know that my Redeemer lives

What comfort this sweet sentence gives

He lives, He lives, who once was dead

He lives, my ever living Head

He lives to bless me with His love

He lives to plead for me above

He lives my hungry soul to feed

He lives to help in time of need

He lives triumphant from the grave

He lives eternally to save

He lives all glorious in the sky

He lives exalted there on high

He lives to grant me rich supply

He lives to guide me with His eye

He lives to comfort me when faint

He lives to hear my soul's complaint

He lives to silence all my fears

He lives to wipe away my tears

He lives to calm my troubled heart

He lives all blessings to impart

He lives, my kind, wise, heavenly Friend

He lives and loves me to the end

He lives, and while He lives, I'll sing

He lives, my Prophet, Priest, and King

He lives and grants me daily breath

He lives, and I shall conquer death

He lives my mansion to prepare

He lives to bring me safely there

He lives, all glory to His Name

He lives, my Jesus, still the same

Oh, the sweet joy this sentence gives

I know that my Redeemer lives
