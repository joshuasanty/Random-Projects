Verse 1
Heaven thundered 
and the world was born

Life begins and ends
 in the dust You form

Faith commanded 
and the mountains moved

Fear is losing ground
 to our hope in You

Chorus
Unstoppable God let 
Your glory go on and on

Impossible things in 
Your name they shall be done

Verse 2
Freedom conquered 
all our chains undone

Sin defeated 
Jesus has overcome

Mercy triumphed 
when the third day dawned

Darkness was denied 
when the storm was gone

Bridge
Nothing shall be impossible Your kingdom 
reigns unstoppable

We'll shout Your praise forevermore Jesus our 
God unstoppable

Interlude
Oh oh
Oh oh

Outro
Oh
