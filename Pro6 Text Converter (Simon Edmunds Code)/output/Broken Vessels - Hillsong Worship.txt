Verse 1
All these pieces, 
broken and scattered

In mercy gathered, 
mended and whole

Empty handed, 
but not forsaken

I've been set free, 
I've been set free

Pre-Chorus
Amazing grace, 
how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me

I once was lost 
but now I am found
Was blind but now I see

Chorus
Oh I can see You now
Oh I can see the 
love in Your eyes

Laying Yourself down
Raising up the broken to life

Verse 2
You take our failure, 
You take our weakness

You set Your treasure
in jars of clay

So take this heart, Lord, 
I'll be Your vessel
The world to see, Your life in me
