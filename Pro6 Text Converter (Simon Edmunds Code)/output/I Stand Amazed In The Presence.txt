Verse 1
I stand amazed in the presence

Of Jesus the Nazarene

And wonder how He could love me

A sinner, condemned, unclean

Chorus 1
How marvelous! How wonderful

And my song shall ever be

How marvelous! How wonderful

Is my Savior's love for me

Verse 2
He took my sins and my sorrows

And made them His very own

He bore the burden to Calvary

And suffered and died alone

Verse 3
When with the ransomed in glory

His face I at last shall see

It will be my joy through the ages

to sing of His love for me
