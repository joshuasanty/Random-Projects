Verse 1
I'm calling on the God of Jacob
Whose love endures through generations

I know that You will keep Your covenant
I'm calling on the God of Moses

The one who opened up the ocean
I need you now to do the same thing for me

Chorus 1
Oh God my God I need You
Oh God my God I need You now
How I need You no

Oh Rock oh Rock of ages
I'm standing on Your faithfulness

Verse 2
I'm calling on the God of Mary
Whose favor rests upon the lowly

I know with You all things are possible
I'm calling on the God of David

Who made a shepherd boy courageous
I may not face Goliath

But I've got my own giants

Bridge 1
You heard Your children then You hear Your children now
You are the same God You are the same God

You answered prayers back then And You will answer now
You are the same God You are the same God

You were providing then You are providing now
You are the same God You are the same God

Bridge 2
You moved in power then God move in power now
You are the same God You are the same God

You were a healer then. You are a healer now
You are the same God You are the same God

You were a Savior then You are a Savior now
You are the same God You are the same God

Ending
I'm calling on the Holy Spirit
Almighty River, come and fill me again
