Verse 1
In Christ alone my hope is found
He is my light, my strength, my song

This cornerstone, this solid ground
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm

What heights of love, what depths of peace
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease

My comforter, my all in all
Here in the love of Christ I stand

Verse 2
In Christ alone! Who took on flesh
Fullness of God in helpless babe

This gift of love and righteousness
Scorned by the ones he came to save

Till on that cross as Jesus died
The wrath of God was satisfied

For every sin on Him was laid
Here in the death of Christ I live

Verse 3
There in the ground His body lay
Light of the world by darkness slain

Then bursting forth in glorious day
Up from the grave He rose again

And as He stands in victory
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me

For I am His and He is mine
Bought with the precious blood of Christ

Verse 4
No guilt in life, no fear in death
This is the pow'r of Christ in me

From life's first cry to final breath
Jesus commands my destiny

No power of hell, no scheme of man
Can ever pluck me from His hand

'til He returns or calls me home
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Bridge 1
I find my strength, I find my hope
I find my help in Christ alone

When fear assails, when darkness falls
I find my peace in Christ alone

I give my life, I give my all
I sing my song to Christ alone

The King of kings, the Lord I love
All heaven sings to Christ alone
