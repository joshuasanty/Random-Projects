Verse 1
The head that once was crowned with thorns
Is crowned with glory now

The Savior knelt to wash our feet
Now at his feet we bow

Verse 2
The one who wore our sin and shame
Now robed in majesty 

The radiance of perfect love
Now shines for all to see

Chorus
Your name, Your name, 
Is victory

All praise, will rise, 
To Christ our king

Verse 3
The fear that held us now gives way
To him who is our peace

His final breath upon the cross
Is now alive in me

Bridge
By your spirit I will rise
From the ashes of defeat

The resurrected king
Is resurrecting me

In your name I come alive
To declare your victory

The resurrected king
Is resurrecting me

Verse 4
The tomb where soldiers watched in vain
Was borrowed for three days

His body there 
would not remain

Our God has robbed the grave
Our God has robbed the grave
