This is my confidence
You've never failed me yet

Your word will come to pass

My heart will sing your praise again
Jesus you're still enough

Keep me within your love
My heart will sing your praise again

I've seen you move
You move the mountains

You made a way
Where there was no way

And I believe
I'll see you do it again
