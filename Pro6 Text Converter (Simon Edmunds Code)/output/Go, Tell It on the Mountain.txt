Chorus:
Go, tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go, tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Verse 1:
While shepherds kept their watching
Over silent flocks by night

Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Verse 2:
The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo! above the earth

Rang out the angels chorus
That hailed the Savior's birth

Verse 3:
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born

And God sent us salvation
That blessed Christmas morn
