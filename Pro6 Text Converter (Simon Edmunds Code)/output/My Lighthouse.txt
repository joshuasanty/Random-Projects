In the questions Your truth will hold

Shining in the darkness I will follow You oh

My Lighthouse my Lighthouse
I will trust the promise You will carry me

safe to shore 
safe to shore

With each morning I'll rise and sing

Shining in the darkness I will follow You oh

My Lighthouse my Lighthouse
I will trust the promise You will carry me
