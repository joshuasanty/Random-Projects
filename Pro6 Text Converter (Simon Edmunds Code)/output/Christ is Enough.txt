Verse 1
Christ is my reward
And all of my devotion

Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy

Through every trial
My soul will sing

No turning back
I've been set free

Chorus
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me

Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

Verse 2
Christ my all in all
The joy of my salvation

And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home

Through every storm
My soul will sing

Jesus is here
To God be the glory

Bridge 1
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back

The cross before me
the world behind me

No turning back, no turning back
The cross before me

the world behind me
No turning back, No turning back

Chorus
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me

Everything I need is in You
Everything I need

Bridge 2
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, No turning back

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back

I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back, no turning back
