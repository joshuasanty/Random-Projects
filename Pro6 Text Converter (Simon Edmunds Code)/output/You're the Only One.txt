Verse 1
Though the earth may try, 
to satisfy my heart

Though the earth may try, 
to tell me you're not faithful

Though the earth may try, 
to blind me from your goodness

You shine through

Chorus
You're the only one who
Fills me up

You're the only one who
Fills me up

You're the only one who
Fills me up

You're the only one
