Verse 1
Standing here in Your presence
In a grace so relentless
I am won by perfect love

Wrapped within the 
arms of heaven

In a peace that lasts forever
Sinking deep in mercy's sea

Chorus
I'm wide awake
drawing close stirred by grace
And all my heart is Yours

All fear removed
I breathe You in I lean 
into Your love

Oh Your love

Verse 2
When I'm lost You pursue me
Lift my head to see Your glory
Lord of all so beautiful

Here in You I find shelter
Captivated by the 
splendor of Your face

My secret place

Bridge
Your love so deep 
is washing over me

Your face is all I seek 
You are my everything

Jesus Christ 
You are my one desire

Lord hear my only cry 
to know You all my life
