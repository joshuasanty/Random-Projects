Verse 1
Were creation suddenly articulate
With a thousand tongues to lift one cry

Then from north to south and east to west
We'd hear Christ be magnified

Verse 2
Were the whole earth echoing His eminence
His name would burst from sea and sky

From rivers to the mountain tops
We'd hear Christ be magnified

Chorus 1
O Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

O Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

Verse 3
When ev'ry creature finds its inmost melody
And ev'ry human heart its native cry

O then in one enraptured hymn of praise
We'll sing Christ Be magnified

Chorus 1
O Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

O Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me

Bridge 1
I won't bow to idols
I'll stand strong and worship You

And if it puts me in the fire
I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too

I won't be formed by feelings
I hold fast to what is true

If the cross brings transformation
Then I'll be crucified with You

Bridge 2
'Cause death is just the doorway
Into resurrection life

If I join You in Your suff'rings
Then I'll join You when You rise

And when You return in glory
With all the angels and the saints

My heart will still be singing
My song will be the same

Chorus 1
O Christ be magnified
Let His praise arise
Christ be magnified in me

O Christ be magnified
From the altar of my life
Christ be magnified in me
