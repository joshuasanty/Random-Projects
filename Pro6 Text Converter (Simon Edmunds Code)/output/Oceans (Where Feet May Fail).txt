Verse 1
You call me out 
upon the waters

The great unknown 
where feet may fail

And there I find 
You in the mystery

In oceans deep 
my faith will stand

Chorus
So I will call 
upon Your name

And keep my eyes 
above the waves

When oceans rise my soul 
will rest in Your embrace

For I am Yours 
and You are mine

Verse 2
Your grace abounds 
in deepest waters

Your sovereign hand 
will be my guide

Where feet may fail 
and fear surrounds me

You've never failed 
and You won't start no

Bridge
Spirit lead me where 
my trust is without borders

Let me walk upon the waters wherever You would call me

Take me deeper than my 
feet could ever wander

And my faith will be 
made stronger, in the 
presence of my Savior

Interlude
Oh, Jesus, you're my God
