Verse 1: 
God rest ye merry, gentlemen, let nothing you dismay

Remember Christ our Savior was born on Christmas Day

To save us all from Satan's power when we were gone astray

Chorus:

O tidings of comfort and joy, comfort and joy

O tidings of comfort and joy

Verse 2:

In Bethlehem, in Israel, this blessed Babe was born

And laid within a manger upon this blessed morn

The which His mother Mary did nothing take in scorn

From God our heavenly Father a blessed angel came

And unto certain shepherds brought tidings of the same

How that in Bethlehem was born the Son of God by name

Verse 4:

"Fear not, then," said the angel, "Let nothing you affright

This day is born a Savior of a pure Virgin bright

To free all those who trust in Him from Satan's power and might.

Verse 5:

The shepherds at those tidings rejoiced much in mind

And left their flocks a-feeding in tempest, storm and wind

And went to Bethlehem straightaway this blessed Babe to find

Verse 6:

But when to Bethlehem they came where our dear Savior lay

They found Him in a manger where oxen feed on hay

His mother Mary kneeling unto the Lord did pray

Verse 7:

Now to the Lord sing praises all you within this place

And with true love and brotherhood each other now embrace

This holy tide of Christmas all others doth deface

Verse 8:

God bless the ruler of this house, and send him long to reign

And many a merry Christmas may live to see again

Among your friends and kindred that live both far and near

Tag:

That God send you a happy new year, happy new year

And God send you a happy new year
