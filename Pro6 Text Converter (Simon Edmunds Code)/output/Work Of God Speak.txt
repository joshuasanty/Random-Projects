Verse 1
I'm finding myself
at a loss for words

And the funny thing is it's okay

The last thing I need
is to be heard

But to hear 
what You would say

Chorus
Word of God speak
Would You pour down like rain

Washing my eyes to see 
Your majesty

To be still and know
that You're in this place

Please let me stay and rest
In Your holiness, 
Word of God speak

Verse 2
I'm finding myself
in the midst of You

Beyond the music, 
beyond the noise

All that I need is to be with You
And in the quiet hear Your voice

Outro
I'm finding myself 
at a loss for words

And the funny thing is it's okay
