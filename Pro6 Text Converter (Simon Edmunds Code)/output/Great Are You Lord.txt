Verse 1
You give life, You are love
You bring light to the darkness

You give hope, You restore
Every heart that is broken

And great are You, Lord

Chorus
It's Your breath in our lungs
So we pour out our praise

We pour out our praise
It's Your breath in our lungs

So we pour out our praise
To You only

Bridge
And all the earth will 
shout Your praise

Our hearts will cry
These bones will sing

Great are You, Lord
