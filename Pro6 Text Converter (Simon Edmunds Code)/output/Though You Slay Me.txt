Verse 1
I come, God, I come
I return to the Lord

The one who’s broken
The one who’s torn me apart

You strike down to bind me up
You say you do it all in love

That I might know you 
in your suffering

Chorus
Though you slay me
Yet I will praise you

Though you take from me
I will bless your name

Though you ruin me
Still I will worship

Sing a song to the one 
who’s all I need

Verse 2
My heart and flesh may fail
The earth below give way

But with my eyes, with my eyes I’ll see the Lord

Lifted high on that day
Behold, the Lamb that was slain

And I’ll know every tear 
was worth it all

Bridge
Though tonight I’m crying out
Let this cup pass from me no

You’re still more than I need
You’re enough for me
You’re enough for me
