Verse 1
Remember those walls that we called sin and shame
They were like prisons that we couldn't escape

But He came, and He died, and He rose,
Those walls are rubble no

Verse 2
Remember those giants we called death and grave
They were like mountains that stood in our way

But He came, and He died, and He rose,
Those giants are dead no

Chorus
This is our God this is who He is
He loves us

This is our God this is what He does
He saves us

He bore the cross beat the grave
Let heaven and earth proclaim
This is our God King Jesus

Verse 3
Remember that fear that took our breath away
Faith so weak that we could barely pray

But He heard, every word, every whisper

Verse 4
Now those altars in the wilderness
Tell the story of His faithfulness

Never once did He fail and He never will

Bridge 1
Who pulled me out of that pit
He did He did

Who paid for all of our sin
Nobody but Jesus

Bridge 2
Who rescued me from that grave
Yahweh Yahweh

Who gets the glory and praise
Nobody but Jesus

Bridge 2a
Who rescued me from that grave
Yahweh Yahweh

Who gets the glory and praise
Nobody but HIM

Ending
He bore the cross beat the grave
Let heaven and earth proclaim
This is our God King Jesus
