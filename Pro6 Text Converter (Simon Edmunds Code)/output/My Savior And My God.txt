Verse 1
I am not skilled to understand
What God has willed, what God has planned

I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior

I take Him at His word and deed
Christ died to save me this I read

And in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior

That He would leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die

You count it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior

Chorus 1
My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me

My God He was, my God He is,
My God He's always gonna be

My Savior loves, my Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me

My God He was, my God He is,
My God He's always gonna be

Verse 2
Yes, living, dying let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring

That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior

That He would leave His place on High
And come for sinful man to die

You count it strange so once did I
Before I knew my Savior

Chorus 1
My Savior loves, My Savior lives
My Savior's always there for me

My God He was, My God He is, 
My God He's always gonna be

My Savior lives, My Savior loves
My Savior lives, My Savior loves
