I can't do anything
I can't say anything

I can't face anything apart from You

You are everything
So my soul will sing

I'm not anything apart from You

I can't do anything
I can't say anything

I can't face anything apart from You

You are everything
So my soul will sing

I'm not anything apart from You

Lord, Your life is the air that I breathe

Every promise You've given sustains me

There is nothing on earth that I need,
but to be with You

I can't do anything
I can't say anything

I can't face anything apart from You

You are everything
So my soul will sing

I'm not anything apart from You

Lord, Your life is the air that I breathe

Every promise You've given sustains me

There is nothing on earth that I need,
but to be with You

I can't do anything
I can't say anything

I can't face anything apart from You

You are everything
So my soul will sing

I'm not anything apart from You

I can't do anything
I can't say anything

I can't face anything apart from You

You are everything
And so my soul will sing

I'm not anything apart from You

I'm not anything apart from You

I'm not anything apart from You
