Verse 1
O come behold 
the works of God
The nations at His feet

He breaks the bow 
and bends the spear

And tells the wars to cease
O mighty one of Israel

You are on our side
We walk by faith in God who burns
The chariots with fire

Chorus
Lord of hosts You’re with us with us in the fire

With us as a shelter 
With us in the storm

You will lead us through 
the fiercest battle

Oh where else would we go 
but with the Lord of hosts

Verse 2
O God of Jacob fierce and great
You lift Your voice to speak

The earth it bows in awe
The mountains move into the sea

O Lord you know the hearts of men
And still You let them live

O God who makes the mountains melt
Come wrestle us and win

Bridge
Though oceans roar 
You are the Lord of all

The One who calms 
the wind and waves

And makes my heart be still
Though the earth gives way

The mountains move into the sea
The nations rage I know
 my God is in control
