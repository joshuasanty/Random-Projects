Verse 1
He's coming on the clouds 
Kings and kingdoms will bow down

And every chain will break as broken hearts declare His praise

For who can stop 
the Lord Almighty

Chorus
Our God is the Lion, 
the Lion of Judah

He's roaring with power 
and fighting our battles

And every knee 
will bow before Him

Our God is the Lamb, 
the Lamb that was slain

For the sins of the world,
 His blood breaks the chains

And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb

Every knee will bow before Him

Verse 2
So open up the gates 
Make way before the King of kings

The God who comes to save is here to set the captives free

For who can stop 
the Lord Almighty

Bridge
Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord Almighty

Who can stop the Lord Almighty
Who can stop the Lord

Outro
And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb

And every knee will bow before the Lion and the Lamb
