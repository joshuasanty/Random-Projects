May His favor be upon you
And a thousand generations

And your family and your children
And their children and their children

Bridge 2
May His presence go before you
And behind you and beside you

All around you and within you
He is with you he is with you

In the morning in the evening
In your coming and your going

In your weeping and rejoicing
He is for you He is for you

He is for you He is for you
He is for you He is for you

He is for you He is for you
He is for you He is for you

And a thousand generations

And your family and your children
And their children and their children

May His presence go before you
And behind you and beside you

All around you and within you
He is with you he is with you

In the morning in the evening
In your coming and your going

In your weeping and rejoicing
He is for you He is for you
