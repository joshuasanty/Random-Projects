Verse 1
Let it be Jesus
The first name that I call
Let it be Jesus

My song inside the storm
I'll never need another

Chorus 1
For me to live is Christ
For me to live is Christ

God I breathe Your name
Above everything
Let it be let it be Jesus

Verse 2
Let it be Jesus
From the rising of the sun
Let it be Jesus

Verse 2
When all is said and done
I'll never need another
Jesus there's no other

Bridge 1
Should I ever be abandoned
Should I ever be acclaimed
Should I ever be surrounded

Bridge 1
By the fire and the flame
There's a name I will remember

Bridge 1
There's a name I will proclaim
Let it be, let it be Jesus
