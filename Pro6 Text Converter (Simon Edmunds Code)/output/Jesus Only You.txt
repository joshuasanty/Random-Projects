Verse 1:
Who have I in Heaven but You

Who have I on Earth to see me through

Jesus only You

Who can break the chains that tie me down

Free me from the lies by which I'm bound

Jesus only You

Chorus:

By Your blood, You have claimed me

You have called me Your own

By Your love, You sustain me

I am never alone

Verse 2:

Who will hold me as I breathe my last

Welcome me home when this life's past

Jesus only You
