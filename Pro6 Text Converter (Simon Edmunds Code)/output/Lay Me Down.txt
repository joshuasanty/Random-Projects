Verse 1
With this heart 
Open wide

From the depths 
From the heights

I will bring a sacrifice

Verse 2
With these hands 
Lifted high

Hear my song, 
Hear my cry

I will bring a sacrifice
I will bring a sacrifice

Chorus
I lay me down I’m not my own
I belong to you alone

Lay me down, 
Lay me down

Hand on my heart 
This much is true

There’s no life apart from you
Lay me down, lay me down

Verse 3
Letting go of my pride
Giving up all my rights

Take this life and let it shine
Take this life and let it shine

Bridge
It will be my joy to say
Your will Your way

It will be my joy to say
Your will Your way

It will be my joy to say
Your will Your way always
