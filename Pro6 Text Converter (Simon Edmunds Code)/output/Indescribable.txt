Verse 1
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea,
creation's revealing Your majesty

From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring

every creature unique in the song that it sings
All exclaiming

Chorus 1
Indescribable, uncontainable

You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name
You are amazing, God

And all powerful, untamable,
awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim

You are amazing, God

Verse 2
Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go

or seen heavenly store houses laden with snow

Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light

yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night?
None can fathom

Tag
Incomparable, unchangeable,
You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God
