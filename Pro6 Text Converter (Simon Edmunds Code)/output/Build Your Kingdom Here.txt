Chorus
Build Your kingdom here, let the darkness fear

Show Your mighty hand, heal our streets and land

Set Your church on fire, win this nation back

Change the atmosphere, build Your kingdom here we pray

Verse 1
Come set Your rule and reign in our hearts again

Increase in us we pray; unveil why we're made

Come set our hearts ablaze with hope like wildfire in our very souls
Holy Spirit come invade us no

We are Your church; we need Your pow'r in us

Verse 2
We seek Your kingdom first, we hunger and we thirst

Refuse to waste our lives for You're our joy and prize

To see the captives' hearts released, the hurt the sick the poor at peace

We lay down our lives for heaven's cause

We are Your church; we pray revive this earth

Verse 3
Unleash Your kingdom's pow'r, reaching the near and far

No force of hell can stop your beauty changing hearts

You made us for much more than this, awake the kingdom seed in us

Fill us with the strength and love of Christ

We are Your church; we'll spread your hope on earth
