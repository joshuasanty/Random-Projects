No other name on 
Earth is worthy

No other name in
Heaven above

No other name is 
Sung in glory

But Jesus, God's
Redeeming Son

No other name on 
Earth is worthy

No other name in
Heaven above

No other name is
 sung in glory

But Jesus, God's
Redeeming Son

No other name 
Would die for me

No other name
Could cleanse my sin

No other name
Could set me free

Jesus, Your Name
Will have no end

No other name on 
Earth is worthy

No other name in
Heaven above

No other name is 
Sung in glory

But Jesus, God's
Redeeming Son

No other name
Would die for me

No other name
Could cleanse my sin

No other name
Could set me free

Jesus, Your Name
Will have no end

No other name
Would die for me

No other name
Could cleanse my sin

No other name
Could set me free

Jesus, Your Name
Will have no end

Jesus, Your Name
Will have no end

Jesus, Your Name
Will have no end

No other name
On earth is worthy

No other name
In heaven above

No other name
Is sung in glory

But Jesus, God's
Redeeming Son
