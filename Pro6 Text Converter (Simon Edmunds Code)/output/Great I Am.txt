Verse 1
I want to be close, 
Close to your side

So heaven is real 
And death is a lie

I want to hear voices 
Of angels above

Singing as one

Chorus
Hallelujah, holy, holy
God almighty, the great I am

Who is worthy, none beside thee
God almighty, the great I am

Verse 2
I want to be near, 
Near to your heart

Loving the world 
And hating the dark

I want to see dry 
Bones living again

Singing as one

Bridge
The mountains shake 
Before you

The demons run 
And flee

At the mention of the name 
King of majesty

There is no power in hell 
Or any who can stand

Before the power and the presence of the great I am

The great I am, the great I am
The great I am, the great I am
