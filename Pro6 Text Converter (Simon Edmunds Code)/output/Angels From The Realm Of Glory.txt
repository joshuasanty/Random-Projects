Verse 1:
Angels from the realm of glory
Wing our flight o'er all the earth

Ye who sang creation's story
Now proclaim the Messiah's birth

Refrain:

Come and worship, come and worship
Worship Christ, the newborn King

Verse 2:
Shepherds, in the field abiding
Watching o'er your flocks by night

God with us is now residing
Yonder shines the infant light

Verse 3:
Sages, leave your contemplations
Brighter visions beam afar

Seek the great Desire of nations
Ye have seen His natal star

Verse 4:
Saints, before the altar bending
Watching long in hope and fear

Suddenly the Lord, descending
In His temple shall appear

Verse 5:
Sinners, wrung with true repentance
Doomed for guilt to endless pains

Justice now revokes the sentence
Mercy calls you, break your chains

Verse 6:
Though an infant now we view Him
He shall fill His Father's throne

Gather all nations to Him
Every knee shall then bow down

Verse 7:
All creation, join in praising
God, the Father, Spirit, Son

Evermore your voices raising
To the eternal Three in One
