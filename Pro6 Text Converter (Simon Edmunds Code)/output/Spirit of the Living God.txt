Interlude
Come and speak to us O Lord

Chorus 1
Cause when You speak and when You move

When You do what only You can do

It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek

When You come in the room, when You do what only You can do

It changes us, it changes what we see and what we seek

You're changing ev'rything

Verse 2
Spirit of the living God, Spirit of the living God

We're leaning in to all You are, ev'rything else can wait

Spirit of the living God, Spirit of the living God

Come now and breathe upon our hearts, come now and have Your way

When You move, You move all our fears

When You move, You move us to tears

When You move, You move all our fears

When You move, You move us to tears

When You fall, we fall on our knees

When You fall, we fall at Your feet

And when You fall, we fall on our knees

And when You fall, we fall at Your feet

Spirit of the living God

We only want to hear Your voice

We're hanging on ev'ry word
