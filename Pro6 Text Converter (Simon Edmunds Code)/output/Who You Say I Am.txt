Verse 1
Who am I that the highest King
Would welcome me

I was lost but He brought me in
Oh, His love for me

Chorus 1
Who the Son sets free
Oh, is free indeed

I'm a child of God
Yes, I am

Verse 2
Free at last, He has ransomed me
His grace runs deep

While I was a slave to sin
Jesus died for me, Yes, He died for me

Chorus 2
In my Father's house
There's a place for me

I'm a child of God
Yes, I am

Bridge 1
I am chosen
Not forsaken
I am who You say I am

You are for me
Not against me
I am who You say I am

Tag
Oh, I am who You say I am
Yes, I am who You say I am
