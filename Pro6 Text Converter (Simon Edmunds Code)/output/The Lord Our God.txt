Verse 1
Promise maker, promise keeper
You finish what You begin

Our provision through the desert
You see it through 'til the end

You see it through 'til the end

Chorus
The Lord our God is ever faithful
Never changing through the ages

From this darkness
You will lead us

And forever we will say
You're the Lord our God

Verse 2
In the silence, in the waiting
Still we can know You are good

All Your plans are for Your glory
Yes, we can know You are good

Yes, we can know You are good

Chorus
The Lord our God is ever faithful
Never changing through the ages

From this darkness
You will lead us

And forever we will say
You're the Lord our God

Bridge
We won't move without You
We won't move without You

You're the light of all
And all that we need

Chorus 2
The Lord our God is ever faithful
Never changing through the ages

From this darkness
You will lead us

And forever we will say
You're the Lord our God

Ending
And forever we will say
You're the Lord our God
