For my waking breath, for my daily bread
I depend on You, I depend on You

For the sun to rise, for my sleep at night
I depend on You, I depend on You

You're the way, the truth and the life
You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine
Draw me close and teach me to abide

Where the Spirit leads as I'm following
I depend on You, yes I depend on You

For the victories still in front of me
I depend on You, yes I depend on You

Chorus 2
You're the way, the truth and the life
You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine
Draw me close and teach me to abide

Be my strength, my song in the night
Be my all, my treasure, my prize

I am Yours forever You're mine
Draw me close and teach me to abide

Verse 3
When I pass through death as I enter rest
I depend on You, I depend on You

For eternal life to be raised with Christ
I depend on You, I depend on You

Chorus 2
You're the way, the truth and the life
You're the well that never runs dry

I'm the branch and You are the vine
Draw me close and teach me to abide

Be my strength, my song in the night
Be my all, my treasure, my prize

I am Yours forever You're mine
Draw me close and teach me to abide
