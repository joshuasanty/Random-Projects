Verse 1
I was buried beneath my rebellion,
Lost without hope of redemption

Blind in my need for a Savior,
Oh but God

Verse 2
Crushed by the weight of my failure,
Living the lie I created

Digging my grave without knowing,
Oh but God, oh but God

Chorus 1
Rich in mercy how You loved me,
Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven,
Nailing my sin to a cross
Oh But God

Verse 3
You gave me a truth worth believing,
And I traded my chains for Your freedom

Cause You were the one that I needed,
Oh but God

Verse 4
Resurrecting my heart from the ruins,
My rescue came through like the morning

Verse 4
Now this is my sure testimony,
Oh but God, oh but God

Chorus 1
Rich in mercy how You loved me,
Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven,
Nailing my sin to a cross
Oh but God

Bridge 1
All the wreckage of my choices
You have turned to life from ashes

Lifted from death risen with Him
Now I stand in confidence

Chorus 1
Rich in mercy how You loved me,
Too much to let me stay lost

My salvation sent from heaven,
Nailing my sin to a cross

Oh but God
