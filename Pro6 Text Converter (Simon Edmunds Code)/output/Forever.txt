Verse 1
The moon and stars they wept
The morning sun was dead

The Savior of the 
world was fallen

His body on the cross
His blood poured out for us

The weight of every 
curse upon him

Verse 2
One final breath he gave
As heaven looked away

The Son of God was 
laid in darkness

A battle in the grave
The war on death was waged

The power of hell 
forever broken

Pre-Chorus
The ground began to shake
The stone was rolled away

His perfect love could
not be overcome

Now death where 
is your sting

Our resurrected King
Has rendered you defeated

Chorus
Forever He is glorified
Forever He is lifted high

Forever He is risen
He is alive, He is alive

Bridge
We sing hallelujah
We sing hallelujah

We sing hallelujah
The Lamb has overcome
