Verse 1:
Joy to the world, the Lord is come
Let earth receive her King

Let every heart prepare Him room
And Heaven and nature sing

And Heaven and nature sing
And Heaven and Heaven and nature sing

Verse 2:
Joy to the world, the Savior reigns
Let all their songs employ

While fields and floods, rocks hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy

Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy

Bridge:
Joy, unspeakable joy!
Overflowing well

No tongue can tell
Joy, unspeakable joy

Rises in my soul
Never lets me go

Verse 3:
He rules the world with truth and grace
And makes the nations prove

The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love

And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love

Bridge:
Joy, unspeakable joy!
Overflowing well

No tongue can tell
Joy, unspeakable joy

Rises in my soul
Never lets me go
