Intro
There's honey in the rock 
Water in the stone

Manna on the ground
no matter where I go

I don't need to worry
now that I know

Everything I need You've got
There's honey in the rock

Verse 1
Praying for a miracle
thirsty for the Living Well
Only You can satisfy

Verse 2
Sweetness at the mercy seat
Now I've tasted, it's not hard to see
Only You can satisfy

There's honey in the rock
There's honey in the rock

There's honey in the rock
There's honey in the rock

Verse 3
Freedom where the Spirit is
Bounty in the wilderness
You will always satisfy

There's honey in the rock
water in the stone
Manna on the ground

no matter where I go
I don't need to worry
now that I know

Everything I need You've got
There's honey in the rock

purpose in Your plan
Power in the blood
healing in Your hands

Started flowing when You said it is done
Everything You did's enough

I keep looking,
I keep finding

You keep giving,
keep providing

I have all that I need
You are all that I need

I keep praying,
You keep moving

I keep praising,
You keep proving

I have all that I need
You are all that I need

I have all that I need
You are all that I need
