Holy God
You alone are worthy
of my praise

every breath
I take
for all my days

is Yours
my King

Holy God
I will sing another song
for You

but there's
even more I
want to do
for You my King

I want to give You
more than words

I want to love You
with my life
I want to be a sacrifice

You gave it all
when You paid my price

I want to love You
love You
love You

Holy God
I will not forget
the love You gave

for my sin
the sacrifice was made
by You my King

Holy God
with Your Spirit here
inside of me

Let Your glory shine
for all to see
You are King

I want to give You
more than words

I want to love You
with my life
I want to be a sacrifice

You gave it all
when You paid my price

I want to love You
love You
love You

I want to love You
with my life
I want to be a sacrifice

You gave it all
when You paid my price

I want to love You
love You
love You

oh, Jesus you are worthy
Lord Jesus you are worthy

worthy, worthy
You are worthy, worthy

You are everything
You are everything
You are everything
You are worthy

You are everything
You are everything
You are everything
You are worthy

worthy, worthy
You are worthy, worthy

I want to love You
with my life
I want to be a sacrifice

You gave it all
when You paid my price

I want to love You
love You
love You
