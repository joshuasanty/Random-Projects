Your love for me
Is a healing comfort
For me

Your grace to me
Is a matchless gift
To me

Your power in me
Is a mighty river
In me

At the end of the day
With the setting 
Of the sun

After all is
Said and done

What else can I do
But worship

What else can I do
But bo

All I really long for
Is You

All I really yearn for
Is You

Your sovereignty
Is a sure foundation
For me

Your hope in me
Is enduring peace
In me

Your care for me
Brings a
Sweet surrender
To me

At the end of the day
With the setting 
Of the sun

After all is
Said and done

What else can I do
But worship

What else can I do
But bo

All I really long for
Is You

All I really yearn for
Is You

What else can I do
But praise You

Joining in the sound
Of heaven's song

All I really long for
Is You

All I really yearn for
Is You

Where else would I run
But to You

Where else would I go
God of life

All I really long for
Is You

All I really yearn for
Is You

All I really need Lord
Is You
