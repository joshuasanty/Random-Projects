Awesome in majesty,
Power, and strength

King of eternity
Worthy of praise

Let the reedemed
Of The Lord
Cry out

Let every heart,
Every knee
Bow down

Enthroned in the 
Highest place
You are

Reigning forever

You're The King
Glorious

And Your reign
Victorious

And I'll follow You

Follow You anywhere
