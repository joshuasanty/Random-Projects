Verse 1:
I heard the bells on Christmas day

Their old familiar carols play

And wild and sweet the words repeat

Of peace on earth, good will to men

Verse 2:

And thought how, as the day had come

The belfries of all Christendom

Had rolled along the unbroken song

Of peace on earth, good will to men

Verse 3

Till ringing, singing on its way

The world revolved from night to day

A voice, a chime, a chant sublime

Of peace on earth, good will to men

Verse 4

And in despair I bowed my head

"There is no peace on earth," I said

"For hate is strong and mocks the song

Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Verse 5:

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep

"God is not dead, nor doth He sleep

The wrong shall fail, the right prevail

With peace on earth, good will to men.
