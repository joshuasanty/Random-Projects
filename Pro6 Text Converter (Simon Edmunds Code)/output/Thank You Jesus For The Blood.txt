Verse 1: 
I was a wretch I remember who I was

I was lost I was blind I was running out of time

Sin separated the breach was far too wide

But from the far side of the chasm You held me in Your sight

Verse 2:

So You made a way across the great divide

Left be-hind Heaven's throne to build it here inside

There at the cross You paid the debt I owed

Broke my chains, freed my soul for the first time I had hope

Chorus:

Thank You Jesus for the blood ap-plied

Thank You Jesus it has washed me white

Thank You Jesus You have saved my life

Brought me from the darkness into glorious light

Verse 3:

You took my place laid in-side my tomb of sin

You were buried for three days but then You walked right out again

And now death has no sting and life has no end

For I have been transformed by the blood of the Lamb

Bridge:

There is nothing stronger than then the wonder working power

Of the blood the blood

That calls us sons and daughters we are ransomed by our Father

Through the blood the blood

Thank You Jesus for the blood applied

Thank You Jesus it has washed me white

Thank You Jesus You have saved my life

Glory to His name

Glory to His Name

There to my heart was the blood ap-plied

Glory to His name
