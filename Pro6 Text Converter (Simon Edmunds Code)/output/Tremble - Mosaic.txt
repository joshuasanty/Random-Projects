Verse 1
Peace bring it all to peace,
the storms surrounding me

Let it break at Your name

Verse 2
Still call the sea to still,
the rage in me to still

Every wave at Your name

Chorus
Jesus Jesus 
You make the darkness tremble

Jesus Jesus 
You silence fear

Jesus Jesus 
You make the darkness tremble

Jesus 
Jesus

Verse 3
Breathe call these 
bones to leave

Call these lungs to sing
Once again I will praise

Bridge
Your name is a light 
that the shadows can't deny
Your name cannot be overcome

Your name is alive
forever lifted high
Your name cannot be overcome

Outro
Jesus, Jesus
Jesus, Jesus

Jesus, Jesus, You make the darkness tremble
Jesus, Jesus
