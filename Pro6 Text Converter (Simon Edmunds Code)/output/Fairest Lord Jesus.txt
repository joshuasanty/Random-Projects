Verse 1: 
Fairest Lord Jesus, Ruler of all nature

O Thou of God and man the Son

Thee will I cherish, Thee will I honor

Thou, my soul's glory, joy and crown

Verse 2:

Fair are the meadows, fairer still the woodlands

Robed in the blooming garb of spring

Jesus is fairer, Jesus is purer

Who makes the woeful heart to sing

Verse 3:

Fair is the sunshine

Fairer still the moonlight

And all the twinkling starry host

Jesus shines brighter, Jesus shines purer

Than all the angels heaven can boast

Verse 4:

Beautiful Savior! Lord of all the nations

Son of God and Son of Man

Glory and honor, praise, adoration

Now and forever more be Thine
