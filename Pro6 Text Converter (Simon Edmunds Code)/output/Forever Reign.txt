Verse 1
You are good, you are good
when there's nothing good in me

You are love, you are love
On display for all to see

You are light, you are light
when the darkness closes in

You are hope, You are hope
You have covered all my sin

Verse 2
You are peace, You are peace
When my fear is crippling

You are true, you are true
Even in my wandering

You are joy, You are joy
You're the reason that I sing

You are life, you are life
In you death has lost its sting

Chorus
And oh, I'm running to your arms
I'm running to your arms

The riches of your love
will always be enough

Nothing compares to your embrace
Light of the world forever reign

Verse 3
You are more, you are more
than my words will ever say

You are Lord, you are Lord
all creation will proclaim

You are here, you are here
In your presence I'm made whole

You are God, You are God
of all else I'm letting go

Bridge 1
My heart will sing no other name
Jesus Jesus

Chorus
