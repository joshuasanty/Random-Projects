Verse 1
Your word is a lamp unto my feet
Your way is the only way for me

It's a narrow road that leads to life
But I want to be on it

It's a narrow road but the mercy's wide
'Cause You're good on Your promise

Chorus
I'll take You at Your word
If You said it I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works
If You start it You'll complete it
I'll take You at Your word

Verse 2
You spoke and the chaos fell in line
I know 'cause I've seen it in my life

It's a narrow road that leads to life
But I want to be on it

It's a narrow road the tide is high
But You parted the water

Chorus 2
I'll take You at Your word
If You said it I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works
If You start it You'll complete it
I'll take You at Your word

Bridge 1
You said Your love will never give up
You said Your grace is always enough

You said Your heart would never forget
Or forsake me

You said I'm saved You call me Yours
You said my future's full of Your hope

You've never failed,
So I know that You'll never fail me

Chorus
I'll take You at Your word
If You said it I'll believe it

I've seen how good it works
If You start it You'll complete it

Ending
I'll take You at Your word
