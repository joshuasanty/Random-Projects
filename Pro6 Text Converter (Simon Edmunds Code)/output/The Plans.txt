Verse 1
When I am anxious, when I am afraid
I take it to God, I call on His Name

If the Mover of Mountains 
Is listening to me

Why should I worry
Why should I fear anything

Chorus 1
For I know the plans He has for me
Yes, I know the plans He has for me

For my good
To give me a hope and a future

Verse 2
When I am waiting for 
His promise to come

Sometimes He is silent
But I'm never alone

He walks in the valley 
And He quiets the storm

He stands in the fire
So why should I fear anymore

Chorus
Bridge 1
All my life, all I've seen
Your endless love surrounding me

With every breath I will be found by You
If I set sail or spread my wings

And find myself on the farthest sea
You're waiting there

I will be found by You
I will be found by You

Chorus 2
For I know the plans He has for me
Yes, I know He's working everything

For my good
To give me a hope and a future
