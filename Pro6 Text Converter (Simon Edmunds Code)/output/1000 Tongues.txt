Verse 1
We are a sea of voices
We are an ocean of Your praise

Gathered under one name
We are a tide that's rising

And we cannot be contained
Gathered under one name

Chorus
O for a thousand 
tongues to sing

The glories of our 
Lord God Almighty

O to sing the Savior's praise, the triumph of

His grace, You are worthy 
You are worthy God

Verse 2
We have found our anthem,
At the cross where sin was slain

Gathered under one name
Where every chain is broken

Every sorrow swept away
Gathered under one name

Chorus 2
O for a thousand 
tongues to sing

The glories of our 
Lord God Almighty

O to sing the 
Savior's praise

The triumph of His grace, 
You are worthy

You are worthy God

Bridge
With all heaven sing, 
all earth belo

One holy King, 
one highest throne
