Verse 1
The splendor of the King
Clothed in majesty

Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

He wraps Himself in light
And darkness tries to hide

And trembles at His voice
And trembles at His voice

Chorus
How great is our God
Sing with me

How great is our God
And all will see how great

How great is our God

Verse 2
And age to age He stands
And time is in His hands

Beginning and the End
Beginning and the End

The Godhead three in one
Father Spirit Son

The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Bridge
Name above all names
Worthy of all praise

My heart will sing
How great is our God
