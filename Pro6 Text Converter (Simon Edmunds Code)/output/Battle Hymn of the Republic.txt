Verse 1:
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord

He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored

He hath loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift sword

His truth is marching on

Chorus:
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His truth is marching on

Verse 2:
I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps

They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps

I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps

His day is marching on

Chorus:

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! His day is marching on

Verse 3:

I have read a fiery Gospel writ in burnished rows of steel

"As ye deal with My contemners, so with you My grace shall deal"

Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with His heel

Since God is marching on

Chorus:

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Since God is marching on

Verse 4:

He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat

He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat

Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him; be jubilant, my feet

Our God is marching on

Chorus:

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on

Verse 5:

In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea

With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me

As He died to make men holy, let us live to make men free

While God is marching on

Chorus:

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! While God is marching on

Verse 6:

He is coming like the glory of the morning on the wave

He is wisdom to the mighty, He is honor to the brave

So the world shall be His footstool, and the soul of wrong His slave

Our God is marching on

Chorus:

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Glory! Glory! Hallelujah

Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! Our God is marching on
