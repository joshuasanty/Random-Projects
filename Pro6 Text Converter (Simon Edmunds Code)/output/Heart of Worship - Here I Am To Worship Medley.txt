Verse 1
When the music fades  
All is stripped away

And I simply come 
Longing just to bring

Something that's of worth 
That will bless your heart

Pre-Chorus
I'll bring You more than a song 
For a song in itself

Is not what You have required 
You search much deeper within

Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart

Chorus
I'm coming back to the heart of worship 
And it's all about you

It's all about you, Jesus 
I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing I've made it

When it's all about you, 
It's all about you, Jesus

Bridge Here I Am
And I'll never know how much it cost 
To see my sin upon that cross

Chorus Here I am
So here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down

Here I am to say that    
You're my God

You're all together lovely  
Altogether worthy

Altogether wonderful to me
