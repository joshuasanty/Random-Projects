Verse 1
I hear the Savior say,
Thy strength indeed is small

Child of weakness, 
watch and pray

Find in Me thine all in all

Chorus
Jesus paid it all, 
All to Him I owe

Sin had left a crimson stain, 
He washed it white as sno

Verse 2
Lord, now indeed I find Thy power, and Thine alone

Can change the leper’s spots And melt the heart of stone

Verse 3
And when before the throne, 
I stand in Him complete

Jesus died my soul to save, 
my lips shall still repeat

Bridge
O praise the One 
who paid my debt

And raised this life 
up from the dead

O praise the One 
who paid my debt

And raised this life 
up from the dead
