Verse 1
I need You, to soften my heart
to break me apart

I need You, to open my eyes,
to see that You're 
shaping my life

Pre-Chorus
All I am, 
I surrender

Chorus
Give me faith
to trust what You say

That You're good
and Your love is great

I'm broken inside,
I give You my life

Verse 2
I need You, to soften my heart
to break me apart

I need You, to pierce 
through the dark and 
cleanse every part of me

Bridge
And I may be weak
but Your Spirit's strong in me

My flesh may fail,
but my God, You never will
