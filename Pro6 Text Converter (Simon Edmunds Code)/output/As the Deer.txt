Verse 1
As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

Chorus 1
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

Verse 2
You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are the King

And I love You more than any other
Even more than anything

Chorus 2
You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

You alone are my strength, my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield

You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship You

And I long to worship You
