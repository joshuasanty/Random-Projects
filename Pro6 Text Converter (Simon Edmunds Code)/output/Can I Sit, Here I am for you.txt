Verse 1:
Can I sit with you awhile
Can You hold me I'm Your child

Can I come to You with words so few
and rest inside Your arms

Can I sit with You
awhile

Verse 2:
Can I listen to Your heart
Can I feel it beat with mine

I've come to love
the way You cover me with who You are

Can I listen
to Your heart

Verse 3:
What better friend what better father
No greater King no other savior

My only God my perfect lover
Here I am for You
