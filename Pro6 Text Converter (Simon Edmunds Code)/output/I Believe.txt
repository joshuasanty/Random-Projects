I believe 
that You love 
I believe that 
You save

I believe that 
You died and 
rose from 
the grave

Oh Jesus 
You know 
I believe it

I believe 
by Your word 
everything
came to be

I believe 
that your blood 
has set me free

Oh Jesus 
You know 
I believe it

Some may doubt
That You are true

I believe 
that You are God

I believe 
with all my heart

I can see 
that who You are

Is all 
I'll ever need

You know 
I Believe

I believe that
 You knew me
 long before
 I was here

I believe
 that Your plan
 for me
 is clear

Oh Jesus
 You know
 I believe it

I believe
 that in power
 You defeated
 death

I believe
 that You give me every single
 breath

Oh Jesus
 You know
 I believe it

Some may doubt
That You are true

I believe 
that You are God

I believe 
with all my heart

I can see 
that who You are

Is all 
I'll ever need

You know 
I Believe
