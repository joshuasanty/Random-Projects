Verse 1
All sufficient merit
Shining like the sun

A fortune I inherit
By no work I have done

My righteousness I forfeit
At my Savior's cross

Where all sufficient merit
Did what I could not

Verse 2
In love He condescended
Eternal now in time

A life without a blemish
The Maker made to die

The law could never save us
Our lawlessness had won

Until the pure and spotless
Lamb had finally come

Chorus 1
It is done it is finished
No more debt I owe

Paid in full all sufficient
Merit now my own

Verse 3
I lay down my garments
Any empty boasts

Good works all corrupted
By the sinful host

Dressed in my Lord Jesus
A crimson robe made white

No more fear of judgement
His righteousness is mine

Chorus 1
It is done it is finished
No more debt I owe

Paid in full all sufficient
Merit now my own

Verse 4
All sufficient merit
Firm in life and death

The joy of my salvation
Shall be my final breath

And when I stand accepted
Before the throne of God

I'll gaze upon my Jesus
And thank Him for the cross

Tag
Yes I'll thank Him for the cross

Ending
Your merit now my own
Your merit now my own
