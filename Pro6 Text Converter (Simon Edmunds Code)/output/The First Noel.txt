Verse 1:
The first Noel the angel did say

Was to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay

In fields where they lay tending their sheep

On a cold winter's night that was so deep

Chorus:

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

Verse 2:

They looked up and saw a star

Shining in the east, beyond them far

And to the earth it gave great light

And so it continued both day and night

Verse 3:

And by the light of that same star

Three Wise Men came from country far

To seek for a King was their intent

And to follow the star wherever it went

Verse 4:

This star drew nigh to the northwest

Over Bethlehem it took its rest

And there it did both stop and stay

Right over the place where Jesus lay

Verse 5:

Then did they know assuredly

Within that house the King did lie

One entered it them for to see

And found the Babe in poverty
