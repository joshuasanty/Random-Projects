Verse 1:
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene

And wonder how He could love me
A sinner condemned unclean

Chorus:
How marvelous how wonderful
And my song shall ever be

How marvelous how wonderful
Is my Savior's love for me

Verse 2:
He took my sins and my sorrows
He made them His very own

He bore the burden to Calvary
And suffered and died alone

Verse 3:
When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see

Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me
