Verse 1
Oh Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds Thy hands have made

I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy pow'r throughout the universe displayed

Chorus
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Verse 2
And when I think that God, His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in

That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Chorus
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Verse 3
When Christ shall come, with shouts of acclamation
And lead me home, what joy shall fill my heart

Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great Thou art

Chorus
Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Then sings my soul my Savior God to Thee
How great Thou art, how great Thou art

Chorus 2
Praise the Lord, Oh my soul
Praise the Lord, Oh my soul

I won't be quiet, My God is alive
How could I keep it inside

Praise the Lord, oh my soul

Bridge 1
I'll praise cause you're sovereign
Praise cause you reign

Praise cause you rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise cause you're faithful

Praise cause you're true
Praise cause there's nobody greater than you
