Verse 1
Worthy of ev'ry song we could ever sing
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring

Worthy of ev'ry breath we could ever breathe We live for You

Verse 2
Jesus the name above ev'ry other name
Jesus the only one who could ever save

Worthy of ev'ry breath we could ever breathe
We live for You We live for You

Chorus
Holy there is no one like You There is none besides You
Open up my eyes in wonder

Show me who You are And fill me with Your heart
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Bridge 1
I will build my life upon Your love
It is a firm foundation

I will put my trust in You alone
And I will not be shaken
