Verse 1
When I survey the wondrous cross
On which the Prince of Glory died

My richest gain I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

Verse 2
See from His head His hands His feet
Sorrow and love flow mingled down

Did e'er such love and sorrow meet
Or thorns compose so rich a crown

Chorus 1
O the wonderful cross
O the wonderful cross

Bids me come and die and find That I may truly live
O the wonderful cross

O the wonderful cross
All who gather here by grace Draw near and bless Your name

Verse 3
Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small

Love so amazing so divine
Demands my soul my life my all
