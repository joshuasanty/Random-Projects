Verse 1:
O little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting Light

The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight

Verse 2:

For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above

While mortals sleep, the angels keep their watch of wondering love

O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth

And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth

Verse 3:

How silently, how silently, the wondrous Gift is given

So God imparts to human hearts the blessings of His heaven

No ear may hear His coming, but in this world of sin

Where meek souls will receive Him still, the dear Christ enters in

Verse 4:

Where children pure and happy pray to the blessed Child

Where misery cries out to Thee, Son of the mother mild

Where charity stands watching and faith holds wide the door

The dark night wakes, the glory breaks, and Christmas comes once more

Verse 5:

O holy Child of Bethlehem, descend to us, we pray

Cast out our sin, and enter in, be born in us today

We hear the Christmas angels the great glad tidings tell

O come to us, abide with us, our Lord Emmanuel
