Verse 1
You unravel me with a melody

You surround me with a song

Of deliverance from my enemies

Til all my fears are gone

Chorus 1
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

Verse 2
From my mother's womb

You have chosen me

Love has called my name

I've been born again

Into your family

Your blood flows through my veins

Chorus 1
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

Interlude
Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohh Ohh Ohhhh

Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohh Ohh Ohhhh

Bridge 1
You split the sea

So I could walk right through it

My fears were drowned

In perfect love

You rescued me

And I will stand and sing

I am a child of God

Yes, I am

I am a child of God

I am a child of God

Full of faith

Yes, I am a child of God

I am a child of God

Chorus 1
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
