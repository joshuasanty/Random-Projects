Verse 1
My life is Yours
And my hope is in You only

And my heart You hold

'Cause You made 
this sinner holy

And holy, 
holy

Chorus
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
I fall onto my knees in awe

And the heartbeat of my life
Is to worship in Your light

'Cause Your glory is so beautiful
'Cause Your glory is so beautiful

Bridge
Glory glory hallelujah
Jesus You are good

Verse 2
What can wash away my sin

Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus

What can make 
me whole again

Nothing but the 
Blood of Jesus

Oh! Precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow

Oh, No other fount I know
Nothing but the Blood of Jesus
