Verse 1
Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness

Opened my eyes
Let me see

Beauty that made
This heart adore you

Hope of a life
Spent with you

Chorus 1
Here I am to Worship
Here I am to bow down

Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely

Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

Verse 2
King of all my days
Oh so highly exalted

Glorious in heaven above
Humbly you came

To the earth you created
All for love's sake
Became poor

Bridge 1
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sins upon that Cross

Bridge 1
I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sins upon that Cross
