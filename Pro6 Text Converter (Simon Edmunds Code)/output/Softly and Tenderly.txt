Verse 1
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for you and for me

See on the portals he's waiting and watching,
Watching for you and for me

Chorus 1
Come home, come home
You who are weary come home

Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,
Calling, O sinner, come home

Verse 2
Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading,
Pleading for you and for me

Why should we linger and heed not his mercies,
Mercies for you and for me

Verse 3
Oh! for the wonderful love he has promised,
Promised for you and for me

Though we have sinned, he has mercy and pardon,
Pardon for you and for me
