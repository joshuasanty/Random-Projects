Are you hurting and broken within

Overwhelmed by the weight of your sin

Jesus is calling

Have you come to the end of yourself

Do you thirst for a drink from the well

Jesus is calling

O come to the altar

The Father's arms are open wide

Forgiveness was bought with

The precious blood of Jesus Christ

Leave behind your regrets and mistakes

Come today there's no reason to wait

Bring your sorrows and trade them for joy

From the ashes a new life is born

Jesus is calling

Oh what a savior
Isn't he wonderful

Sing Hallelujah

Bow down before him
For he is Lord of all

Sing Hallelujah
Christ is risen

Bear your cross as you wait for the crown

Tell the world of the treasure you found

Jesus is calling
