Verse 1

by day or by night

Waking or sleeping, 
Thy presence my light

Be Thou my Wisdom, 
be Thou my true Word

I ever with Thee and 
Thou with me Lord

Thou my great Father, 
and I Thy true son

Thou in me dwelling, 
and I with Thee one

Riches I heed not, 
nor man's empty praise

Thou mine Inheritance, 
now and always

Thou and Thou only, 
first in my heart

High King of heaven, 
my Treasure Thou art

Verse 4
High King of heaven, 
when victory won

May I reach heaven's joys, 
O bright Heaven's sun

Heart of my own heart, 
whatever befall

Still be my Vision, 
O Ruler of all

Heart of my own heart, 
whatever befall

Still be my Vision, 
O Ruler of all
