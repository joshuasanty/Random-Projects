Verse 1:
He knows Earth's Deepest Sorrow,
He knows our highest joy

The deepest darkest sins of years,
He's able to destroy

He knows the deep heart longings
The hidden tears that flow

There's nothing that overtakes us,
But what our Lord doth know

Chorus
He knows, (He knows)
He knows, (He knows)

He knows, yes,
Jesus knows; (He knows)

He's able to deliver,
For He knows, He knows

Verse 2
He knows along life's pathway
Are trials for His sake

But tho' they dim our vision still,
He knows the way we take

In His own way He leads us,
Because He loves us so

And when the heart grows weary,
He knows, our Lord doth know

Verse 3
He knows the heart that trusts Him
In these dark trying hours

When thorns are in life's pathway here
Or when it's strewn with flowers

He knows his own and leads them
In pastures of tender green

Has treasures laid up for loved ones,
By mortal eye unseen
